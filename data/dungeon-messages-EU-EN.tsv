9067030	"They are awakening!"
9067031	"The real battle begins now!"
9067032	"Did you think this would be easy?"
9068001	"Pahoegar is preparing a curse!"
9068002	"Pahoegar is at peak power!"
9068003	"The eyes of Lakan are upon you!"
9068004	"The gate is closing."
9068005	"Dakuryon unleashes a triple explosion."
9068006	"You're my next experimental subject!"
9068007	"Lakan's Might is mine!"
9068008	"Pahoegar is gathering power!"
9068009	"Dakuryon is preparing a curse!"
9068010	"Attack!"

9068015	"The gate will close in 5 seconds."
9068016	"Dakuryon is gathering energy."
9068017	"Dakuryon is absorbing power from the Bloodshard!"
9068018	"Dakuryon is on a rampage!"
9068019	"Dakuryon is preparing to unleash Lakan's Might."
9068020	"Dakuryon's trap has sprung!"
9068021	"There is nothing you can do to stop Pahoegar!"
9069010	"We're all doomed!"
9069011	"I'm going to die!"
9069014	"I think I saw the map you're looking for...in Anea's chamber."
9069015	"I can take you there!"
9069016	"I remember it distinctly!"
9069017	"We can go this way!"
9069018	"That way is the barracks. Lots of soldiers and new weapons and stuff. It's safer this way."
9069020	"No...please. If I go that way, they'll kill me for sure!"
9069100	"We don't know exactly where it is... but there's supposed to be a map with the Fountain marked on it, hidden somewhere in the castle."
9069102	"We just have to make sure they don't get the Storm Barrier up before we leave, then."
9069103	"Did everyone else see that? Those were devans..."
9069104	"Quiet...there's someone in there."
9069105	"Randun! Find someplace safe and stay there!"
9069109	"I'm going this way."
9069110	"The Guidance Room?"
9069111	"Bodies!"
9069112	"Is this...is this the work of Blood Magic?"
9069113	"You go on ahead. I want to get a closer look at this. Nemato and I will catch up with you shortly."
9069114	"More Blood Magic..."
9069115	"Nemato! Show us the way out! I'm going to grab a few samples here..."
9069116	"What?"
9069117	"We can't let that happen. Stay here!"
9069118	"The devans...?"
9069200	"Where would you go? How do we get out of here?"
9069201	"Look at your map!"
9069202	"We don't have time for this. The Fountain is drying up as we speak!"
9069203	"They're almost here...? We should go."
9069204	"Whoa... did you feel that? Something big is coming!"
9069205	"Where does this door go?"
9069206	"New weapons? I'd like to see those."
9069207	"A new weapon! A new weapon! This way!"
9069208	"I don't want to get involved, but what can you do?"
9069209	"If we can not find the Fountain this time.. What is going to happen?"
9069303	"Oh, thank you! Thank you!"
9069317	"Yuk! Don't you feel nauseous? This is where we're staying. Be careful... It's a mess."
9069322	"Thank you, Princess! This way..."
9069601	"Princess Syona! Don't wander off by yourself!"
9069602	"Ready!"
9069603	"Then I suppose I'll go with Randun."
9069604	"Well done. Then, I'll accompany Princess Syona!"
9069605	"Can we just go straight to the Fountain that Seren prophesied?"
9069606	"Well, if we don't succeed, we'll probably find ourselves trapped behind the Storm Barrier."
9069607	"Look! Over there! There's a light!"
9069610	"What should I do?"
9070001	"Manglemore's Change of Heart"
9070002	"Who can you trust?"
9070003	"Wanna play a little game?"
9070004	"See you next time!"
9070005	"Manglemore adds a random buff."
9071001	"Thank you very much!"
9071002	"Dalmanak summons a minion!"

9077003	"Something appears in the center of the arena!"
9077004	"The bloodshard calls for more blood."
9077005	"A gladiator enters the arena!"

9090004	"We're halfway there!"
9090005	"I'm no traitor...stand down!"
9090006	"We must hurry, or they'll overwhelm us!"
9090007	"Not much farther! Fight the good fight!"
9090008	"May the spirits forgive my failure..."
9090009	"Now, I must leave the Fey Forest. My destiny awaits!"
9090010	"Quest failed. You will be teleported out in 3 seconds."
9091001	"Protect Hallie."
9091002	"I'm almost done patching up Serena's ephemeral guardian!"
9091003	"Don't give up!"
9091004	"Hallie's HP has dropped below half. You fail the quest if Hallie dies."
9091005	"Do you want the Eldritch Academy to end this way?"

9811023	"Krakatox summons tentacles to ensnare you!"
9811024	"The gate is closing."
9811025	"The gate is closing."
9811026	"Thalweg is in danger."
9811027	"All the demokrons flock to Thalweg."
9811028	"Thalweg howls, calling the demokrons to him."
9811029	"Krakatox gathers energy."
9811030	"Stop Krakatox before he finishes gathering the energy."
9811031	"The cave is collapsing."
9811032	"The power of the demokron's curse fills the cave."
9811033	"Krakatox is becoming enraged."
9811034	"He grows stronger with time."
9811035	"Thalweg summons Demokrons."
9811036	"When the summoned Demokrons move to Thalweg, his attack power increases."
9811037	"Krakatox can create more bombs now."
9811038	"The demokron energy will kill you 10 minutes from the beginning of the battle."
9813001	"Come, Gatekeeper, and protect me!"
9813002	"Protect me, my warden!"
9813003	"Absorbing the warden is making Banyakas unstable!"
9813004	"You cannot defeat me!"
9813005	"Ghilliedhus come to Banyakas's aid."
9813006	"Banyakas becomes calm when the Dominolith is destroyed."
9813007	"Activate Normal Mode (Temporary Message)"

9813011	"The Guardian has recovered 50% health."
9813012	"The Guardian has recovered 75% health."
9813013	"The Guardian has recovered fully!"
9813014	"I awaken!"
9813015	"The dark warden goes berserk!"
9813018	"Do not interfere with us!"
9813019	"I have regained enough power to destroy the coercive shard!"
9813020	"You protected the Guardian!"
9813021	"I am too injured to move. You must protect me."
9813022	"Banyakas sustains a serious injury and stops moving."
9813023	"As the coercive shard shatters, the mad sporewalker appears."
9813024	"You protected the Gatekeeper!"
9813025	"I'm all right. Go help the petralisks."
9813026	"Thank you for helping me. You must help Banyakas."
9813029	"The last of Banyakas's wardens is about to be enthralled. We have to do something."
9813030	"Can you protect the Guardian while he recovers? He's behind me. Hurry!"
9813031	"The dark wardens collapse as the hypnotic stone is destroyed."
9813032	"The entrance will close soon."
9813033	"The Gatekeeper has been dominated!"
9813034	"The Guardian has been dominated!"
9813035	"That's enough!"
9813036	"Now that the Dominolith is shattered, Banyakas should soon return to his senses."
9813037	"Thank you for protecting our forest. Let me give you this small gift on Banyakas's behalf."
9813038	"Now that the Dominolith is shattered and Banyakas is injured, he will soon return to his senses."
9813039	"Allow me to present you with this small gift on Banyakas's behalf."
9813040	"Thank you very much."
9813041	"Even with their minds enchanted, the Gatekeeper and Guardian tried to protect Banyakas. They will be missed."
9813042	"Wave incoming!"
9814001	"(Touch Oriyn's Arcana.)"
9814002	"Great Power Requires Great Responsibility"
9814003	"Defeat Akvellion to learn what you seek."
9814004	"You have passed Oriyn's trial."
9814005	"Oriyn's Arcana might contain the answers you seek."
9814006	"This doesn't make any sense."
9814007	"Zolyn! Seren's heart, are you all right?"
9814008	"Get lost!"
9814009	"What will we do now?"
9818001	"What is it with all these monsters?"
9818002	"Eeeeeeeeek!"
9818003	"We have to help Zolyn!"
9818004	"I'll wrench you up!"
9818007	"Give Zolyn back!"
9818008	"Come on, you monsters!"
9818009	"Was that the last one?"
9818010	"Ha!"
9821001	"These traces don't seem important. Look for another corpse."
9821002	"A strange creature!"
9821003	"This is an archdevan seal. Bring it to Tirene."
9822001	"You are right. What she did, though..."
9822002	"You fool! You led them to me."
9822003	"Forgive me, mistress!"
9822004	"This isn't the time for grief. Let's move!"
9822005	"Show yourself!"
9822006	"Can't be! How could they know...?"
9822007	"Their presence is an inconvenience I could do without."
9822008	"Now, for your penance..."
9822009	"Please, mistress, no. Please!"
9822010	"Silence! Obey my will!"
9822011	"Aaah... Aarrrgh!"
9822012	"Look, Zolyn! It's bigger on the inside!"
9822013	"Hush!"
9822014	"That witch! She magicked him into a demokron!"
9822015	"Hmm..."
9822016	"Oh. Okay."
9822017	"We must stop the archdevas."
9822018	"Oh, don't worry. I am fine."
9822019	"It can't be true! All of these monsters were... people?"
9822020	"Get out of my way!"
9822021	"Curse these archdevas!"
9822022	"Rhodos, I know you're shocked, but we have to catch her."
9822023	"Tush!"
9822024	"Oh, wait! Don't go alone, Zolyn!"

9833005	"Temp 2"
9833006	"That's the one who's sending the dragons to Elenea!"
9833007	"I wish I could toy with you... but I'm busy. Perhaps later."
9833008	"This is just a waste of time."
9833009	"So persistent...!"
9833010	"Over here! There's a survivor!"
9833011	"Hah! Where is your Goddess now?"
9833012	"At least you know what you're capable of, don't you?"
9833013	"How did Velik's pet get all the way here!"
9833014	"You can't stop us! Even if you kill every last dragon!"
9833015	"The Elite Dragons are waiting in Fyrmount for the siege to start."
9833016	"All according to plan... excellent."
9833017	"For Vergos!"
9833018	"Are they after Velik?"
9833019	"Faster, you pathetic wyrms! Into the portal!"
9833020	"Urgh! Help!"
9833021	"This all makes sense now..."
9833022	"These dead soldiers are the reinforcements from Velika..."
9833023	"I'll wait here."
9833024	"Something must be going on over there. Let's check it out."
9833025	"I'll go deeper into the gorge and see what the dragons are up to. I'll see you in a while."
9833026	"Losing a few dragons will not stop us!"
9833027	"It looks like they need to concentrate to control the dragons."
9833028	"I've never seen a plant like this..."
9833029	"Save us! Please!"
9833030	"Thank you! Thank you! I owe you my life!"
9833031	"Finally, I'm safe!"
9833032	"Urgh!"
9833033	"A little late..."
9833034	"He went down the hill!"
9833035	"Give me your word that you won't harm the civilians and our troops."
9833036	"Very well... but the Velika Map is mine."
9833037	"You did all this, just because of a map?"
9833038	"Where could they have taken the prisoners?"
9833039	"More people will get hurt..."
9833040	"What happens if we lose to the dragons?"
9833041	"Something's not right..."
9833042	"It's feeding time for the dragons."
9833043	"We have to destroy that plant, quick!"
9833044	"There was one more, where did he go?"
9833045	"The troops are battling the dragons."
9833046	"Dragons attacking the village? What's going on...?"
9833047	"I've seen what you're capable of. Keep in mind that you won't be able to stop us."
9833050	"Look! It's the Black Dragon!"
9833051	"The group that were with the dragon... who were they?"
9833052	"Vergos...I haven't heard that name in a long time."
9833053	"What's...? Is that... a plant?"
9833054	"Magic that can mind-control dragons...? That's unheard of."
9833055	"With this many of them..."
9833056	"...destroying Elenea is just the start. "
9833057	"Velika is in severe danger... as is the Goddess herself!"
9833058	"Let's rescue the prisoners first."
9833059	"I hope they're still alive."
9833060	"Run! Don't look back!"
9833061	"You might be strong..."
9833062	"...but there's too many of them!"
9833063	"We're almost there. Don't stop now!"
9833064	"It's the same Vergos cultist we saw earlier!"
9833065	"We must hurry!"
9833066	"The follower went down the hill! We can still catch her!"
9833067	"Ver... gos Follower!"
9833068	"Quick! Kill the dragon! Destroy the plant!"
9833069	"There's more over here!"

9887002	"C'mon! Push it! You can do it!"
9887003	"What are you doing? You want to die here?"
9887004	"Don't let it end like this! Don't deny me my revenge!"
9887005	"Arrogant fools, I will handle this myself!"
9887006	"Intruder! Feel the wrath of almighty Lok!"
9887007	"The Soulcrusher approaches!"
9888001	"A secret door opens in the cellar."
9888002	"Keep your guard up!"
9888003	"Pull it together! You're here to fight, not see the sights!"
9888004	"If you must die, then die alone!"
9888005	"Is this...the end?"
9888006	"Such insolence! No one challenges an agent of Atel Akaad...and survives..."
9888007	"Come, Malgarios! Tear them limb from limb!"
9888008	"How? How could such puny amateurs defeat you? You'll rue the day, foolish interlopers, you hear me? Rue the day!"
9889001	"Your meddling ends now...with your death!"
9889002	"The wardens spotted you—be careful!"
9889003	"The wardens approach. Keep them away from me for at least five minutes, okay?"
9889004	"A second wave of wardens!"
9889005	"Here comes the third wave!"
9889006	"A fourth wave? Really?"
9889007	"The final wave of wardens! One way or the other..."
9889008	"All wardens are dead."
9889009	"The barricades at the entrance to the Priest Hall are gone."
9889010	"Lady Terkasia, save me!"

9889106	"After the stone is destroyed, you hear a distant door open."
9889107	"With Akia's death, the grand door opens."
9889108	"The woman grows bigger."
9889109	"A stranger is approaching."
9889110	"Was waiting for you! Terkasia!"
9889111	"It's a success! We've ended the Cultist threat at last!"
9889112	"Destroying Samael's Altar is the last remaining step. Follow me."
9911002	"You set off a trap!"
9911003	"Something falls from above."
9911004	"You disarmed the trap."
9911005	"The chamber door opens."
9911011	"Killed Kelsaik!"
9911012	"Entered Kelsaik's Hall."

9911104	"One tank can't do this alone. It's time to tag."
9911105	"If it's fire, hide behind your tank. Staying alive is your priority."
9911106	"If it jumps, you should jump too."
9911107	"Don't focus on the slaves."
9911108	"You must know you won't escape."
9916001	"Summon the overlord!"
9916002	"Bloodwrath Overlord has arrived."

9916004	"Oh, don't worry, there's plenty of pain to go around."
9916005	"Try me if you dare!"
