118001	"A pallialith has been summoned."
118002	"Get Aura of Healing effect by destroying the pallialith."
118003	"At the end of the battle, the team whose Kumas Boss has the higher HP wins."
118004	"One member of your team can become the Kumas Boss."
118005	"Becoming a Kumas Boss unlocks powerful skills."
181001	"Ouch! Ow! Get away from me!"
181002	"Can anyone hear me? It's me, Paesyn!"
181003	"Zolyn! Dougal! Rhodos! Anyone!"
181004	"Oh, please, just let me go!"
181005	"I am going to die out here, I know it."
181006	"Can't anyone help us?"
181007	"Someone, send help!"
181008	"I just want to go back to the lab!"
181009	"Help! Someone help us!"
181010	"You are a lifesaver."
181011	"You saved my life and my research results."
181012	"Are you, by any chance, interested in archaeology?"
181013	"Demokrons are prevailing. Research will become harder by day."
181014	"Who dares to wake me up from a millennia of dream?"
181015	"You shall accompany my sleep!"
181016	"Your body shall turn stiff!"
181017	"Whoever interferes my rest shall pay the price!"
181018	"Mercy! Krrk!"
181019	"Krrk! Prisoner!"
181020	"This place does stimulate my curiosity!"
181021	"I want to research this area!"
181022	"What a place!"
181023	"I've never been to anywhere like this!"
183001	"Verikam? What is it?"
183002	"What will happen to us now?"
183003	"So much tragedy..."
183004	"No one knows what will happen without Verikam."
183005	"This place is not safe anymore."
183006	"Baraka's cry fills the pitch-dark sky."
183007	"Flag of hell is approaching."
183008	"The end is nigh!"
183009	"A cold night approaches, flowers are hiding their faces in the darkness!"
183010	"Mindless wanderers are bringing ominous fog."
183011	"The Valkyon Federation is here to help!"
183012	"After the darkest hour came the light."
183013	"Our God, Balder, lit the world with his blessings and displaced darkness."
183014	"The seeker rose, spreading the light of benevolence."
183015	"Hence, where there was light, there were praises."

302605	"You shall die in pain!"
302606	"Die!"
302607	"Ha ha ha!"
303101	"Urgh! You caught me off guard."
303102	"You ain’t gonna get any! It's all mine!"
303103	"Hahaha!"
303104	"Hehehe!"
303105	"You no take treasure!"
303106	"Stop that!"
303107	"Take that!"
303108	"I'll get you!"
410001	"For Kaiator!!"
410002	"You can't escape!"
410003	"Don't underestimate the guards!"
410004	"You damned clowns!"
412001	"I'll use this to stun the monster. Then you attack!"
416001	"Ugh."
416002	"Raaaaurgh!"
416003	"Charge! Victory for Valkyon!"
416004	"Leave the patients to me."
416005	"Don't give up now!"
416006	"Steady fast, soldier."
416007	"Rush onward!"
416008	"Take that!"
416009	"Let's finish this!"
416010	"Block the attack."
416011	"Try to block this!"
416012	"Strike, then fade away!"
416013	"Hang in there, soldier."
416014	"Show me what you've got!"
416015	"I'll cover the right!"
416016	"I'll cover the left!"
416017	"There's an opening!"
416018	"I'll watch our backs."
416019	"Awaken, spirits..."
416020	"Never retreat!"
424001	"I shall melt the stone at your feet!"
424002	"Watch out for the blood borers!."
424003	"Puny wretches! I'll sup from your skulls!"
424004	"You cannot best me with your feeble powers!"
424005	"An enemy emerges from the portal."
425001	"Locking onto {targetName}."

425012	"The purifier is active."
425013	"Neg has been summoned! Lure it to a pond!"
425014	"Targeting a bead at {targetName}!"
425015	"Restore the vision of your party member to normal by using a mirror!"

426011	"About to rush {targetName}!"
426012	"Magnus Sorgalur approaches!"
426013	"Laser rotation attack prepared!"
427001	"Did you like that? I have more!"
427002	"Is that the best you have in you?"
427003	"Now or later, you will bow to our queen."
427004	"You'll pray for death before I'm done."
427006	"You're lucky!"
427010	"Come to me! Die for me!"
427011	"No! You won't defeat me. You cannot defeat me!"
427015	"All who oppose me die. You are no different."
427016	"What chance do you have against me? None!"
427018	"Come in if you like. You won't be leaving again."
427019	"Ah, there you are. You've saved me coming to find you."
427021	"They told me some fools were coming here to die."
427022	"You think victory is within your grasp? Wrong!"
427023	"Why don't you just die quietly?"
427025	"So you have a death wish. Very well. I shall grant it."
427026	"You have awakened me. It seems you crave terror and death."
427027	"Behold the finest example of argon evolution! Me!"
427028	"My ecstasy of evolution is your pain!"
427029	"I have been called to life that you might die."
427030	"Wake up, faithful ones. Your time has come."
427036	"You think to hurt me? You'll have to touch me first!"
427040	"I come bringing death!"
427044	"I'll take great pleasure in killing you."
427046	"This is the end of your journey."
427047	"Stay still, and I'll kill you quickly."
427048	"A wave of evil washes over you."
427049	"Insufficient! You can't stop the queen's wrath."
427050	"Great ones! Lend me your powers!"
427051	"You must know you won't escape."
427052	"Three cells have exploded! Avoid them or you'll lose HP!"
427053	"The beginning of argon evolution!"
429001	"Followers...! Give me your strength...!"
429002	"There is no sanctuary, no fortress, where you can hide from me!"
429003	"Let me show you an impenetrable defense!"
429004	"Do you really think my traps are my only trick?"
429005	"There is no other way..."
429006	"Vermin! I will wipe you out...all of you!"
429007	"Irritating pests...! I shall exterminate you!"
429008	"Die, you puny bugs!"
429009	"Have you been enjoying my little traps?"
429010	"We...we triggered some kind of drill. It cut right through us. If you have to go in there, my advice there is to hide behind the giant crab and use it as a shield!"
429011	"Archdevans! Archdevans everywhere!"
429012	"No, NO! The ritual is not yet complete!"
429013	"Innntruuuderrrr...kiiillll...innntrrruuuderrsss..."
429014	"Intruders? Keep them away! The resurrection process is not yet complete!"
429015	"Guards! Kill them!"
429016	"An intruder! Protect the machine, or Cornus will have our hides!"
429017	"Dodge this!"
429018	"Ha! You fools!"
429019	"Kaprima Reborn is starting the Curse Summon Ritual!"
429020	"It will take more than just pushing some statues around!"
429021	"The Archdevans really don't want visitors! They put up these statues, that sap your health and reduces your power and endurance. And they can only be moved by normal attacks. If you're going in there, I wish you luck."
429022	"What is the meaning of this? You leave me with no choice!"
429023	"Statue summoned! Attack it to push it far away!"
429024	"Move quickly toward {targetName}!"
434101	"Summon explosive barrels!"
434102	"Akasha summons a large army."
434103	"Hahaha, {targetName}! Is that all you can do?"
434104	"Wake up! I'm waiting!"
434201	"Finally, all is complete!"
434202	"Time for a sacrifice."
434203	"You are nothing to my power!"
434204	"Worthless..."
434205	"Nowhere to hide, {targetName}!"
434301	"Iron will!"
434302	"I will rip you apart!"
434401	"Taste this!"
434500	"Kelsaik prepares to summon minions."
434501	"You useless, filthy souls..."
434502	"Rise, my minions!"
434503	"Heat... More heat!"
434504	"I-it's too cold!"
434505	"Ice... More ice!"
434506	"I-it's too hot!"
434600	"Here comes more prey!"
434601	"You are not prepared to face me!"
434602	"Krakatox creates a demokron virus zone around {targetName}."
434603	"{targetName} is grappled by tentacles!"
434604	"The Demokron Shard has been created."
434605	"The Demokron Shard will explode in a few seconds."
434801	"Your doom is near..."
434802	"Rokdos is concentrating his energy. Destroy the crate to stop him."
434803	"Viyor is concentrating his energy. Destroy the crate to stop him."
434804	"Rokdos! Keep an eye out for them!"
434805	"Viyor! Slay them!"
434806	"Who hungers for my curse?"
434901	"Let me remind you of the nightmare of minions."
434902	"Bow your heads, fools!"
443001	"You'll never get through here!"
443002	"No one here but blubbering seals. Ha!"
443003	"Enemies!"
443004	"Look around very carefully!"
443005	"My blood is pumping—I'll show you real pain!"
443006	"Hehe..."
443007	"We have no mercy for the likes of you."
443008	"We'll devour you whole—even your bones!"
443009	"We'll pull your teeth out!"
443010	"A new toy? For me? Smash!"
443011	"Rollin' rollin' rollin'!"
443012	"Let's see if you can avoid this one too!"
443013	"Die! Die!"
443014	"Haha!"
443015	"I will never let you go!"
443016	"This herb will save everybody."
443017	"There are so many monsters."
443018	"You are so good!"
443019	"If this kind of poison spreads in your body, you won't survive."
443020	"Making an antidote is such profound work!"
443021	"Good thing I studied!"
443022	"We're almost there."
443023	"Gah! So much energy! I will crush you!"
443024	"Ha...can you break this curse?"
443025	"Now you're trapped!"
443026	"Go, go, go! Defeat them!"
443027	"Don't go in...you won't make it back out."
443028	"Remember...you must kill them at the same time."
443029	"Hey! Come over here! Hey!"
443030	"Don't make me angry!"
443031	"This will be your grave."
443032	"Bring me their heads!"
443033	"Who do you think you are?"
443034	"Minions! See to their demise!"
443035	"You're the infiltrators, are you?"
443036	"Let's see how good you are!"
443037	"Haha!"
443038	"Obey me!"
443039	"A stone is rolling in!"
443040	"Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!"
443041	"Incorrect order. Prepare for death."
443042	"The curse will take effect in 3 seconds."

443049	"Correct cancellation order."
443050	"The curse will be canceled in 3 seconds."
443051	"I found you!"
443052	"Die!"
443053	"C'mere! I'll take you down!"
443054	"Prepare for the worst!"
443055	"Break the siege weapons!"
443056	"Guard Golem!"
443057	"AAARGH!"
443058	"You're outnumbered!"
443059	"The curse will be canceled soon."
443060	"The curse has taken effect."
443061	"The curse has been canceled."
443062	"You think you're lucky?"
443063	"Ha!"
443064	"You can't run from me!"
443065	"That's a point for me!"
443066	"Ready for more?"
443067	"You're better than I thought...I'm surprised! But you're dead now!"
443068	"Beat up those bastards!"
443069	"They've destroyed the tombstone!"
443070	"Attack!"
443071	"Protect the warden!"
443072	"No! My shield!"
443073	"I can't lose like this."
443074	"Die!"
443075	"I can't believe this!"
443076	"You came for my potion?"
443077	"I hate insects."
443078	"I was cursed...after that, I don't remember a thing."
443079	"Light...I see light!"
443080	"You won't get your way!"
443081	"I will protect Aliss myself!"
443082	"Roll! Roll!"
443083	"One! More! Time!"
443084	"Ack! "
443099	"We'll boil you into soup!"
443999	"Bah! You guys aren't too bad. See you later!"
444100	"I waited far too long to have my revenge!"
444200	"You dare face me?"
444201	"Your clumsy tricks cannot deceive me, mortal!"
444202	"Time to die!"
444203	"Feel my wrath!"
444204	"Nothing left...but vengeance, justice, flame, and blood."
444205	"I hope you still live, Tithus. It is I who shall bring death upon you!"
444206	"The Frenzied Troops are on their way."
444207	"I shall not tolerate such disrespect, {targetName}!"
444208	"I...am...the Fire Lord!"
444209	"Die, mortals!"
444210	"Scream, you weaklings! Those will be your last words."
450001	"Yativio spawned minions to shield itself!"
450002	"Ain't no crime, if it's suppertime!"
450003	"Whack! Whack! Right on your head!"
450004	"Feed me! Feeeeed me!"
450005	"We're killer buds!"
450006	"Koleogg is building up a lightning charge!"
450007	"Get ready for the buzz!"
450009	"Vesporax sprays the cave with acid!"
450010	"I'm so hungry! I need to eat!"
450011	"Who wants to feed me next?"
450012	"You can't fight nature, little ones!"
450013	"Koleogg's lightning charge is almost ready!"
450014	"Koleogg blasts the nest with lightning!"
450015	"Ha! Did you like that?"
450016	"Whoa! Whoa!"
450017	"It's growing! Growing!"
450018	"Give me more power!"
450019	"I can feel the power coursing through me!"
450020	"The ground quakes!"
450021	"Shh. Don't get caught."
450022	"I could eat a cow—but you'll do..."
450023	"Irritating imbeciles!"
450024	"You won't take my treasure!"
450025	"I'll kill you all!"
450026	"{targetName}! Vesporax is summoning bees!"
450027	"Looks like everyone is ready. Let's go."
450028	"What a perfect day to launch an airship."
450029	"Phweet! Let's go, Azzem!"
450030	"Stupid monsters! Take that!"
450031	"Do you hear that squeaking sound?"
450032	"Aha! there it is. I found it."
450033	"Kill that ugly plant. Do it with a single blow."
450034	"You're strong enough, aren't you?"
450035	"Show me you've got the right stuff."
450036	"Become a live bomb!!"
451001	"Waa!"
451002	"Wa waa!"

452015	"Heehee!"
452016	"Gifts from Gluda!"
452017	"Chomp!"
452018	"Tasty!"

452035	"Guards! Guards!"
453001	"Crack that whip!"
453002	"Eat this!"
453003	"Kezzel is casting a powerful attack. Destroy the shield to stop the casting."
453004	"I’ll burn everything to ashes!"
453005	"Here goes another one!"
454001	"These might sting a bit."
454002	"Nightmare Fulminar gathers power for a massive attack."
454003	"Let's cut you down to size!"
454004	"I bring you the gift of annihilation!"
454005	"Water rushes into the chamber."
454006	"Water rushes into the chamber."
454007	"Water rushes into the chamber."
454008	"The pool is draining."
454009	"The pool is drained."
454010	"Can you control your fear? I doubt it!"
454011	"You cannot withstand the full brunt of my power!"
454012	"The air's too fresh. Let's fix that!"
454013	"There's no antidote for my fury!"
454014	"It's kamaras all the way down!"
454015	"Fulminar prepares to strike a fatal blow."
454016	"Let's speed up this dance!"
456001	"The creatures of my realm will punish you all!"
456002	"The Dark Seal begins to shine..."
456003	"The Sun Seal begins to shine..."
456004	"The World Seal begins to shine..."
456010	"Come closer, little mote!"
456011	"There are those who are not yet in my realm still!"
456012	"There are those who are not yet in my realm still!(2)"
456013	"There are those who are not yet in my realm still!(3)"
456014	"There are those who are not yet in my realm still!(4)"
456015	"My power has been gathering in this realm!"
456016	"Who is so bold as to enter my realm?"
456017	"Who are you to touch my statue?"
456018	"Who is so bold as to enter my realm?"
456019	"Who is so bold as to enter my realm?"
456020	"We will meet again!"
456021	"Fools! I am the storm incarnate!"
456022	"Come, my beautiful children!"

823110102	"Aaarrgh! Help!"
823110103	"Begone, monsters!"
823110104	"I can't see clearly through this smoke."

823301003	"I will send you to the deck."
823301004	"Hurry, please."
1000300241	"They say ghosts stalk this place."
1000300242	"The vigilantes are really quite effective."
1000300243	"Sometimes people die. Often, actually."
1000300244	"Thanks for your help."
1000300245	"The undead! They just keep coming!"
1000300246	"Devas in the deep forest...doesn't bode well. There's going to be trouble, and soon."
1000300247	"Something feels...eerie whenever I come through here."
1000300248	"Someday I'm going to be powerful, too!"
1001600021	"Take me away from here!"
1001600022	"I'm headed to Alethea's."
1001600023	"After centuries of restraint, the vampirs' bloodthirst has overwhelmed them."
1001600024	"Atel Akaad? Don't say that name! They're going to kill me! They'll kill you, too!"
1001600025	"Lots of very scary things around here."
1020210381	"Oink!"
1020210382	"Oink-oink?"
1020210383	"Oink?"

1020210390	"My wife...where is she...?"
1020210391	"Thank you! Thank you!"
1020210392	"The Goddess closes her eyes"
1020210393	"Deep in the skies where the shadow lies"
1020210394	"When the butterfly swings her wings"
1020210395	"Let the queen soar up high"
1020210396	"After the golden jewel appears"
1020210397	"The hero shall fall and disappear"
1020310281	"We're getting there."
1020310282	"Keep up! You're not exhausted already?"
1020310283	"I'm glad you're here."
1020310284	"The devas are bad but the monsters?"
1020310285	"If I don't get through, nobody wins! Not the town, not you, especially not me."
1020310286	"Don't wander off!"
1020310287	"Please, stay close and protect me!"
1020310288	"Cheer up! We're almost there."
1020610401	"Please take me to Sozia!"
1020610402	"I'm worried about the others."
1020610403	"Let me out!"
1020610404	"The gutrends raided my town. It's unspeakable what they did."
1020610405	"Thank you! Thank you! I owe you my life!"
1022110451	"Please save me!"
1022110452	"I need to deliver the report to Delir."
1022110453	"How do you like Delir? Gorgeous, eh?"
1022110454	"Wonderful! We're making good progress here."
1022110455	"Still a long way to the base..."
1022110456	"Maybe Balrug will reward you when we get there."
1022110457	"Thanks for helping me."
1022110458	"How about...this way?"
1022510201	"I'll prove I'm no coward."
1022510202	"Fear is for the weak."
1022510203	"Watch out!"
1022510204	"How dare you insult me?"
1023000001	"I smell treasure!"
1023000002	"This doesn't seem to be our best option..."
1023000003	"Over here!"
1023000004	"It's somewhere nearby!"
1023000005	"It's treasure! I'm certain!"
1023000006	"I smell treasure!"
1023000007	"I'll call the nagas. Everyone, run!"
1023000008	"Damn! Caught!"
1023000009	"The information stays with us! Fall back!"
1023000010	"Retreat!"
1023000011	"I'll open a retreat teleportal."
1023000012	"I'll summon the nagas."
1023000013	"Secure the relic!"
1023000014	"What's that sound!? They must have found out!"
1023000015	"Let's check if there are any scouts nearby."
1023000016	"This way!"
1023000017	"Take this!"
1023000018	"Open the exit teleportal!"
1023000019	"Looks like they've all made it. Now, I'll teach you a lesson!"
1023000020	"Hmm. Seems they're not here..."
1023030161	"Maaaaah!"
1023030162	"Maa-aa-aah!"
1023030163	"Baaaah..."
1023030164	"Greep!"
1023030165	"Reep!"
1023030166	"Grawwwp!"
1023220022	"The Nexus is recovering. I'll see you next time."
1048790011	"Never forgive the cult of Lok!"
1048790012	"I'll repay my brother's suffering in blood!"
1048790013	"To my side, quickly! It's dangerous to be spread out."
1048790014	"This place...here..."
1048790015	"Come, quickly!"
1048790016	"Follow me."
1048790017	"My brother was a good soldier."
1048790018	"Why are they here? This can't be good."
2001011301	"We are from the Azart. We follow the wisdom of our Mother."
2001011302	"It may be hard to believe, but Free Exodor made this cave."
2001011303	"This cave makes us feel as if we're in Azart."
2001011304	"Free Exodor stands against oppression from the draakons."
2001011305	"Nagas who follow Vogzu are in this cave."
2001011306	"I'm sure that we can help each other."
2001011307	"Come this way."
2011001000	"That was close!"
2011001001	"Pull yourself together!"
2011001002	"You're taking too much damage!"
2011001003	"That was almost the end of us!"
2011001004	"Concentrate!"
2011001010	"Use a potion before it's too late!"
2011001011	"You need to recover! Quick!"
2011001012	"Every movement counts! Be careful!"
2011001013	"You need to recover!"
2011001020	"You get hurt all the time..."
2011001021	"Come on! You can do this!"
2011001022	"You should recover your health."
2011001023	"Potions aren't always for an emergency. Use them to prevent emergencies!"
2011002000	"You're low on MP!"
2011002001	"You need replenishment!"
2011002002	"You can't fight without MP! Use a potion!"
2011002010	"Hmm...maybe you have enough MP, I guess."
2011002011	"Hey, nice skill chain!"
2011002012	"How about using your MP potion?"
2011003000	"Don't wear yourself out."
2011003001	"Look at you all tired out."
2011003010	"Are you sure you don't need a break?"
2011003011	"You should learn how to act more efficiently."
2011003012	"You need to take a rest!"
2011005000	"Things are getting serious now!"
2011005001	"Watch out!"
2011005002	"Things are getting dangerous..."
2011005003	"Let's get this done with!"
2011005004	"Looks like a troubled {MonsterName}. Something's wrong."
2011005005	"Angry {MonsterName}!"
2011005006	"Oh no! Furious {MonsterName}!"
2011006000	"Master!"
2011006001	"Master...?"
2011006002	"This can't be..."
2011006003	"No! No...Master!"
2011006004	"Get up Master...get up!"
2011006005	"Fainted? Again?"
2011007000	"You worried me to death!"
2011007001	"Thank goodness you're alright now."
2011007002	"Let's keep our eyes wide open this time!"
2011007003	"It's payback time!"
2011007004	"What would you do without me?"
2011008000	"Level up!"
2011008001	"Congratulations!"
2011008002	"You leveled up! Nice work!"
2011008003	"Level up! You don't have to thank me."
2011009000	"You should check your inventory more often."
2011009001	"You don't have any space in your inventory."
2011009002	"Your inventory is full!"
2011009003	"You need to clear your inventory first."
2011010000	"HP Potion!"
2011010001	"Always make sure you have enough health!"
2011010002	"Bottoms up!"
2011010003	"You'll be good as new!"
2011010010	"MP Potion!"
2011010011	"Don't wait until you'll all out of MP!"
2011010012	"Drink it all the way up!"
2011010013	"Good! Plenty of MP now!"
2011010020	"Did you just use a battle solution?"
2011010021	"You're using a battle solution!"
2011010022	"You're well prepared!"
2011010023	"Keep up the good work, Master!"
2011010030	"Thanks for the gift!"
2011010031	"This is just what I wanted!"
2011010032	"This is my favorite...how did you know!"
2011010033	"A gift? Yay!"
2011010034	"Um...thanks..."
2011011000	"You got something pretty good!"
2011011001	"I knew you'd find something good!"
2011011002	"Congratulations!"
2011011003	"You got something!"
2011011004	"Wow! That was great!"
2011012000	"You did it!"
2011012001	"Nicely done!"
2011012002	"Yes!"
2011012003	"It's our lucky day, isn't it?"
2011012004	"I'd knew this day would come!"
2011013000	"Keep your chin up!"
2011013001	"You're not giving up are you?"
2011013002	"Aww...look on the bright side."
2011013003	"Talk about luck."
2011014000	"You need to repair your gear!"
2011014001	"Bad luck happens."
2011014002	"Aww...you're going to have to repair that."
2011015000	"Cheer up."
2011015001	"I'm so sorry, Master..."
2011015002	"Let's take a deep breath."
2011017000	"You missed me that much?"
2011017001	"Hey!"
2011017002	"What took you so long!"
2011017003	"What should I do now?"
2011017004	"You really need me, don't you?"
2011017005	"Just when it was nap time!"
2011017006	"{ServantName} to the rescue!"
2011019000	"I can't catch up!"
2011019001	"I'm exhausted..."
2011019002	"A gift for me...?"
2011019003	"My friend got a gift from his master..."
2011019004	"Do you have something for me...?"
2011019005	"I'm so tired."
2011020000	"It's my time to shine!"
2011020001	"I'll help you!"
2011020002	"This will help!"
2011020003	"Let me help you!"
2011020010	"This should help you on your journey."
2011020011	"Now is the time!"
2011020012	"Here's a little gift."
2011020020	"Crafting? Me too!"
2011020021	"This will do the trick!"
2011020022	"Please! A critical success!"
2011020030	"I can help you fish!"
2011020031	"The BAFs will be here in no time!"
2011020032	"Come on, come on!"
2011020040	"You're gathering? Let me help!"
2011020041	"Gathering will be a lot faster now."
2011020042	"Let's gather!"
2011021000	"You're using a good bait, right?"
2011021001	"Well, you look like you know what you're doing."
2011021002	"Concentrate!"
2011021003	"This seems to be a good spot!"
2011022000	"You got a bite!"
2011022001	"Pull! Pull!"
2011022002	"Now!"
2011023000	"It's a big one! Don't let it get away!"
2011023001	"Hang on tight!"
2011023002	"You can do it! Pull!"
2011024000	"Who could it be?"
2011024001	"I hope it's a present!"
2011024002	"What now?"
2011024003	"A letter?"
2011024004	"Is it something good?"
2011025000	"I hope we'll have fun with the others."
2011025001	"I can't wait to see who we'll meet!"
2011025002	"I can't wait!"
2011026000	"Let's go!"
2011026001	"Show them what you can do!"
2011026002	"You'll do well this time!"
2011026003	"Are you ready?"
2011027000	"Is that something nice?"
2011027001	"Let me do it next time!"
2011027002	"Looks like we've got something!"
2011028000	"Nice crafting!"
2011028001	"I didn't know you could do that!"
2011028002	"Wow! Did you craft all of that?"
2011029000	"I've never seen such great work!"
2011029001	"Looks like it's your lucky day!"
2011029002	"Aww, you don't have to thank me!"
2011031000	"What should we learn this time?"
2011031001	"You should check if there's anything you can learn!"
2011031002	"Congratulations!"
2011032000	"Skill advancement points! Yay!"
2011032001	"Which skill will it be?"
2011032002	"You're getting stronger day by day!"
2011033000	"You just sold something!"
2011033001	"Does this mean I get a present?"
2011033002	"Is there anything you can't do?"
2011034000	"A new achievement!"
2011034001	"Nice one, master!"
2011034002	"An achievement! Congratulations master!"
2011034003	"You did great."
2011100000	"You're out of HP potions!"
2011100001	"You'd better buy some HP potions."
2011100002	"You don't have any HP potions!"
2011100003	"You ran out of HP potions!"
2011100010	"You're out of MP potions!"
2011100011	"You'd better buy some MP potions."
2011100012	"You don't have any MP potions!"
2011100013	"You ran out of MP potions!"
2011100020	"You need potions!"
2011100021	"You'd better buy some potions."
2011100022	"You don't have any potions!"
2011100023	"You're out of potions!"
2012001000	"Fall back!"
2012001001	"Quick! Recover!"
2012001002	"Let's get you patched up first!"
2012001003	"Run for it!"
2012001004	"You won't last long if you keep fighting like that!"
2012001010	"You're hurt! Quick! Recover!"
2012001011	"You're in danger!"
2012001012	"Use your potion!"
2012001013	"Potion! Now!"
2012001020	"This would be the most efficient time to recover."
2012001021	"The priority in a battle is always safety."
2012001022	"I recommend you heal yourself."
2012001023	"It's best to heal before you're in danger."
2012002000	"You're almost out of MP."
2012002001	"A battle without MP is too dangerous!"
2012002002	"You won't be able to use skills without MP."
2012002010	"You've used half of your MP."
2012002011	"Use your MP wisely."
2012002012	"Beware of your MP amount."
2012003000	"You're running out of Resolve!"
2012003001	"You don't have enough Resolve!"
2012003010	"Always keep an eye on your Resolve."
2012003011	"You need to calm down."
2012003012	"You won't make it through the battle like this."
2012005000	"Beware! That enemy has become enraged."
2012005001	"Focus!"
2012005002	"Concentrate on the enemy!"
2012005003	"It's time to turn the fight around!"
2012005004	"Strange {MonsterName} acting strange!"
2012005005	"Now's our chance to attack {MonsterName}!"
2012005006	"Uh oh...{MonsterName}...acting different..."
2012006000	"Master!"
2012006001	"Urgh...Master..."
2012006002	"Master...this can't be..."
2012006003	"Master! No!"
2012006004	"I failed to serve you, Master...forgive me..."
2012006005	"Isn't this a little too much?"
2012007000	"You're back! I was worried!"
2012007001	"Let the battle continue!"
2012007002	"I never doubted you, Master."
2012007003	"We can do it this time!"
2012007004	"Get up!"
2012008000	"I can feel you getting stronger!"
2012008001	"Impressive! Congratulations!"
2012008002	"Nice work!"
2012008003	"Congratulations!"
2012009000	"You don't have enough room in your inventory."
2012009001	"You need to clear your inventory to get new items."
2012009002	"You need to clear your inventory first."
2012009003	"Let's clear out your inventory first."
2012010000	"HP potion!"
2012010001	"You're healing!"
2012010002	"Safety always comes first."
2012010003	"Master! You're recovering!"
2012010010	"MP potion!"
2012010011	"MP is always important."
2012010012	"That was the perfect time to use it!"
2012010013	"Good! You've replenished your MP!"
2012010020	"I sense strong power from the battle solution."
2012010021	"Don't let the power control you!"
2012010022	"Keep an eye on the duration!"
2012010023	"Ready for battle!"
2012010030	"Thank you for the gift."
2012010031	"This is just what I wanted!"
2012010032	"I'm grateful for your gift."
2012010033	"Thank you!"
2012010034	"I'd rather....oh! Never mind."
2012011000	"A gift! Thank you!"
2012011001	"Look like today is your lucky day."
2012011002	"Congratulations!"
2012011003	"That seems to be very useful."
2012011004	"That's pure quality you got there."
2012012000	"We did it!"
2012012001	"Yay! We did it!"
2012012002	"Nicely done!"
2012012003	"It's your lucky day!"
2012012004	"I was waiting for a day like this."
2012013000	"Aww...maybe next time."
2012013001	"Don't be too upset."
2012013002	"You'll make it next time."
2012013003	"Talk about luck!"
2012014000	"Your gear needs to be repaired!"
2012014001	"It's still usable...but it can't be enchanted or be promoted."
2012014002	"Your gear is damaged! Quick! Repair it!"
2012015000	"Bad luck..."
2012015001	"Oh no...this is my fault..."
2012015002	"Don't be so sad, Master!"
2012017000	"Were you looking for me?"
2012017001	"Good day."
2012017002	"I was starting to lose my patience."
2012017003	"How may I help you?"
2012017004	"What would you do without me?"
2012017005	"No rest?"
2012017006	"{ServantName}, at your service."
2012019000	"I can't hold on much longer..."
2012019001	"I need backup!"
2012019002	"I could really use a gift right now..."
2012019003	"A gift would really make me feel happy!"
2012019004	"All the other companions get gifts from their masters..."
2012019005	"I'm exhausted..."
2012020000	"Perfect timing!"
2012020001	"Leave this to me!"
2012020002	"I'm here, Master!"
2012020003	"You seem to be missing this!"
2012020010	"Let me help you!"
2012020011	"It's the perfect time for you to strengthen!"
2012020012	"This is for you."
2012020020	"Let me help you craft!"
2012020021	"You'll get critical successes more often now!"
2012020022	"Good luck!"
2012020030	"Fishing? Let me help you!"
2012020031	"You'll get a BAF soon. Trust me!"
2012020032	"The next one is a BAF for sure! I can feel it!"
2012020040	"Let me help you gather!"
2012020041	"Gathering will be a lot faster now!"
2012020042	"Let's gather!"
2012021000	"Fishing?"
2012021001	"This seems to be a nice spot!"
2012021002	"All we have to do now is just wait."
2012021003	"This is the perfect spot!"
2012022000	"You got something!"
2012022001	"Pull! Now!"
2012022002	"Pull!"
2012023000	"The rod won't make it!"
2012023001	"You've got a big one!"
2012023002	"It'll get away!"
2012024000	"Who is it from?"
2012024001	"Is there a gift?"
2012024002	"Something arrived."
2012024003	"There's a letter for you."
2012024004	"Is it something good?"
2012025000	"I hope you find worthy companions."
2012025001	"Who will we meet?"
2012025002	"I hope the matching doesn't take long."
2012026000	"It's time!"
2012026001	"Let's show them what you're made of."
2012026002	"I know you'll do well."
2012026003	"It's time to go now."
2012027000	"That looks valuable!"
2012027001	"You're good at gathering!"
2012027002	"That was just what you needed!"
2012028000	"Nice work!"
2012028001	"That's a nice item."
2012028002	"Your work always surprises me."
2012029000	"Now that is true masterpiece!"
2012029001	"It's your lucky day!"
2012029002	"It's always a pleasure to help you."
2012031000	"What are you going to learn?"
2012031001	"You should check if there's anything you can learn!"
2012031002	"EP level up! Congratulations!"
2012032000	"You got skill advancement points!"
2012032001	"Which skill will you improve?"
2012032002	"You've gained strength!"
2012033000	"Something just sold!"
2012033001	"You closed the deal!"
2012033002	"I didn't know you were so good at business."
2012034000	"You earned an achievement!"
2012034001	"That was superb!"
2012034002	"Congratulations!"
2012034003	"What did you achieve this time?"
2012100000	"We need more HP potions!"
2012100001	"We're out of HP potions!"
2012100002	"You need to get more HP potions!"
2012100003	"More HP Potions! Now!"
2012100010	"We need more MP potions!"
2012100011	"We're out of MP potions!"
2012100012	"You need to get more MP potions!"
2012100013	"More MP potions! Now!"
2012100020	"We need more potions!"
2012100021	"We're out of potions!"
2012100022	"You need to get more potions!"
2012100023	"More potions! Now!"
2013001000	"Watch out!"
2013001001	"That was close!"
2013001002	"Hang in there!"
2013001003	"You need to recover!"
2013001004	"You'll die if you don't do something!"
2013001010	"Master! Are you alright?"
2013001011	"You need some rest!"
2013001012	"How about using a potion?"
2013001013	"You're hurt! You need to recover!"
2013001020	"Master! Are you okay?"
2013001021	"That hurt, didn't it?"
2013001022	"Take it easy, Master."
2013001023	"Master? Do the potions taste good?"
2013002000	"You need MP to use your skills!"
2013002001	"Now is a good time for an MP potion!"
2013002002	"You're out of MP..."
2013002010	"You're checking your MP, right?"
2013002011	"Don't you need to replenish your MP?"
2013002012	"I always wondered...what do potions taste like?"
2013003000	"You ran out of Resolve!"
2013003001	"You look tired!"
2013003010	"Master, you need some rest!"
2013003011	"Always make sure you have enough Resolve!"
2013003012	"You need more Resolve!"
2013005000	"I feel danger nearby...be careful, Master."
2013005001	"Master, be careful!"
2013005002	"We need to focus..."
2013005003	"Dangerous, but we can do it..."
2013005004	"Eh...unhappy {MonsterName} looks mad."
2013005005	"{MonsterName}...scares me..."
2013005006	"Watch out! {MonsterName}!"
2013006000	"No! Wake up, Master!"
2013006001	"No! Master...get up!"
2013006002	"Master..."
2013006003	"Get up, Master! Get up!"
2013006004	"Master, wake up!"
2013006005	"Again?"
2013007000	"Master! Resurrect!"
2013007001	"Don't forget you can always get back up!"
2013007002	"Yay! Master!"
2013007003	"Let's teach 'em a lesson!"
2013007004	"Come on, master. Get up!"
2013008000	"Master got stronger! Yay!"
2013008001	"Level up! Congratulations!"
2013008002	"Level up! You're even better now!"
2013008003	"Congratulations!"
2013009000	"Inventory is full!"
2013009001	"There's no space left! I checked!"
2013009002	"Get rid of items you don't need!"
2013009003	"You need to clear your inventory first."
2013010000	"HP potion!"
2013010001	"What's that sweet smell?"
2013010002	"This will do the trick!"
2013010003	"Don't be sick!"
2013010010	"MP potion!"
2013010011	"That has a sour smell!"
2013010012	"Is that better?"
2013010013	"Take good care of your MP!"
2013010020	"Did you just use a battle solution?"
2013010021	"That has a sour smell!"
2013010022	"Master just got stronger!"
2013010023	"It doesn't taste so good, does it?"
2013010030	"A gift! Thanks!"
2013010031	"I love it!"
2013010032	"I'm so happy!"
2013010033	"A gift! Yay!"
2013010034	"I could use something better...oh, never mind!"
2013011000	"Congratulations, Master!"
2013011001	"Hip, hip, hooray!"
2013011002	"You don't have to thank me!"
2013011003	"This is something good, isn't it, Master?"
2013011004	"You got something good! Yay!"
2013012000	"I knew it!"
2013012001	"I knew you'd get something good, Master!"
2013012002	"Yes! You did it!"
2013012003	"You're so lucky!"
2013012004	"I knew a day like this would come!"
2013013000	"Hang in there, Master!"
2013013001	"Aww...maybe next time."
2013013002	"You always have another chance! Don't worry!"
2013013003	"Aww...you'll get lucky next time."
2013014000	"No! Your gear!"
2013014001	"Your gear is damaged...you won't be able to enchant or promote it."
2013014002	"Gear damage! Quick! Repair it!"
2013015000	"Chin up, Master!"
2013015001	"Oh...um..."
2013015002	"Cheer up, Master..."
2013017000	"Did you call me?"
2013017001	"Hi, master!"
2013017002	"What took you so long?"
2013017003	"What can I do you for?"
2013017004	"I told you you'll need me!"
2013017005	"Can I have a nap?"

2014001022	"Don't overdo yourself."
2014001023	"Watch your HP."
2014002000	"You need MP to use your skills."
2014002001	"You need to replanish your MP."
2014002002	"You're out of MP."
2014002010	"There isn't enough MP."
2014002011	"Watch your MP."
2014002012	"Do you have enough MP potions?"

2014034002	"Master! Congratulations!"
2014034003	"Woo! Achievement!"
2014100000	"Oops! There's no HP potion. "
2014100001	"It's life threatening to journey without an HP potion!"
2014100002	"Master, don't forget some HP potions!"
2014100003	"An HP potion can save your life."
2014100010	"We ran out of MP, master!"
2014100011	"MP potions make your journey easier."
2014100012	"Oh, don't forget some MP potions!"
2014100013	"An MP potion can save your life, master."
2014100020	"Master! You're out of potions!"
2014100021	"Oh no! We need more potions!"
2014100022	"It's better to have more potions."
2014100023	"You need potions."
2015001000	"Wheeee... "
2015001001	"That was dangerous."
2015001002	"Focus!"
2015001003	"Phew!"
2015001004	"That was close!"
2015001010	"Time to heal!"
2015001011	"You're in danger!"
2015001012	"Attention please!"
2015001013	"Time to recover some HP!"
2015001020	"Don't rest!"
2015001021	"Recovering is crucial."
2015001022	"You lost lots of HP."
2015001023	"Recover HP early."
2015002000	"Your MP is too low."
2015002001	"Time to replenish some MP!"
2015002002	"Not enough MP!"
2015002010	"You've used half of your MP."
2015002011	"MP should be spent efficiently."
2015002012	"Watch your MP."
2015003000	"You don't have enough Resolve!"
2015003001	"Not enough Resolve!"
2015003010	"Keep an eye out for when you might need Resolve."
2015003011	"Getting tired will put you in danger."
2015003012	"Get ready."
2015005000	"The enemy is enraged!"
2015005001	"Be cautious. Your enemy is enraged!"
2015005002	"Be careful!"
2015005003	"No risk, no gain."
2015005004	"That's one angry {MonsterName}!"
2015005005	"Now's our chance to attack. Take this, {MonsterName}!"
2015005006	"That {MonsterName} is acting oddly!"
2015006000	"How dare!"
2015006001	"Master! Master...?"
2015006002	"This can't be!"
2015006003	"Get up, Master! Get up!"
2015006004	"It's my fault."
2015006005	"Hee hee!"
2015007000	"Master!"
2015007001	"We can do it this time!"
2015007002	"We will not run!"
2015007003	"We'll try again!"
2015007004	"I knew you would bounce back!"
2015008000	"You look so strong!"
2015008001	"Congratulations!"
2015008002	"Hooray! You leveled up!"
2015008003	"You are now much stronger!"
2015009000	"Inventory is full!"
2015009001	"You need to clear your inventory"
2015009002	"You should clear some inventory."
2015009003	"It's better to leave some space in inventory."
2015010000	"Recovered HP!"
2015010001	"You'll recover HP."
2015010002	"It's a good time to recover HP!"
2015010003	"Do you feel how your wounds have healed?"
2015010010	"Replenished MP!"
2015010011	"You will replenish MP."
2015010012	"It's a good time to replenish your MP!"
2015010013	"MP is always important."
2015010020	"Did that solution help?"
2015010021	"Solutions make you stronger!"
2015010022	"Elixirs only last so long..."
2015010023	"We're ready now."
2015010030	"It's so overwhelming!"
2015010031	"Thank you so much!"
2015010032	"A gift!"

2015013002	"You'll do it next time."
2015013003	"Tomorrow will be better."
2015014000	"Your gear..."
2015014001	"Your gear needs a little help!"
2015014002	"Damaged gear!"
2015015000	"Oh no, failed!"
2015015001	"Hee hee hee!"

2015019002	"Any gifts for me?"
2015019003	"A gift would make me happy."
2015019004	"I'm exhausted..."
2015019005	"I'm losing energy."
2015020000	"Leave this to me!"
2015020001	"What perfect timing!"
2015020002	"I will help!"

2015020042	"Gathering? I'm in!"

2018001021	"Bravery is the stubbornness of fools."
2018001022	"You had it coming..."
2018001023	"Don't you feel the cold grip of death?"
2018002000	"You are no longer in control of yourself."
2018002001	"Prepare yourself for the vengeance of your enemy."
2018002002	"You're out of MP."
2018002010	"What are you waiting for? Replenish your MP!"
2018002011	"You call that MP replenishment?!"
2018002012	"Listen up, MP is valuable!"
2018003000	"Having trouble breathing?"
2018003001	"You have heard of the word 'retreat', haven't you?"
2018003010	"You're running out of energy."
2018003011	"Please replenish some energy before it's too late."
2018003012	"Energy doesn't grow on trees!"
2018005000	"Stay focused."
2018005001	"Do you feel the wrath? That's {MonsterName}."
2018005002	"It's better to face enemies in this state with a cool head... or not at all."
2018005003	"See everything as an opportunity..."
2018005004	"You're pathetic, {MonsterName}."
2018005005	"It's almost touching how angry {MonsterName} is with me."
2018005006	"The wrath of {MonsterName} is equal to that of a sleep-deprived naga!"
2018006000	"I can't believe you succumb to this little worm."
2018006001	"I'm almost disgusted, {UserName}."
2018006002	"It was inevitable."
2018006003	"Shame on you!"
2018006004	"Yes, that's right, stay down!"
2018006005	"That was to be expected..."
2018007000	"You're tougher than I'd expected."
2018007001	"Don't cause me any grief...!"
2018007002	"Pull yourself together, {UserName}!"
2018007003	"Your tenacity is impressive."
2018007004	"Isn't it comfortable down there?"
2018008000	"Put a bit of elbow grease into it!"
2018008001	"What is it? Waiting for a birthday cake?"
2018008002	"Seems you were worth the wait."
2018008003	"Any cuter and you'll die."
2018009000	"Oh, so greedy?"
2018009001	"Open your eyes! It's in your inventory."
2018009002	"Looking for a trash can, or why are you hauling that around?"
2018009003	"You pick up everything you lay your eyes on."
2018010000	"Seems your civilization hasn't heard of healers, huh?"
2018010001	"An effective cure."
2018010002	"That gets the vital juices flowing."
2018010003	"On your feet and back into battle!"
2018010010	"Ah, the mana's flowing."
2018010011	"Excellent."
2018010012	"Your mana has been replenished."
2018010013	"But now please show some more impressive skills."
2018010020	"You cannot be serious, right...?"
2018010021	"With utmost respect, your efforts do not impress me."
2018010022	"That was effective."
2018010023	"Well? Feeling invigorated?"
2018010030	"Um, what was that supposed to be?"
2018010031	"Are you trying to bribe me?"
2018010032	"Hey, I'm not for sale!"
2018010033	"That won't weaken me."
2018010034	"Leave that and listen."
2018011000	"You've just been collecting crap."
2018011001	"Do you want to keep that?"
2018011002	"That, on the other hand, proving quite popular."
2018011003	"Don't you ever keep track of your inventory?"
2018011004	"Don't you feel... burdened?"
2018012000	"Fate is smiling on you."
2018012001	"You want to give up halfway through?"
2018012002	"You have grown."
2018012003	"That's not going to cut it."
2018012004	"Are you satisfied with that?"
2018013000	"You never seem satisfied."
2018013001	"Tsk, tsk, tsk..."
2018013002	"That was predictable."
2018013003	"Haven't you had enough?"
2018014000	"You're going to need some repairs."
2018014001	"You certainly don't lack ambition."
2018014002	"Haven't you had enough?"
2018015000	"You're such a joker."
2018015001	"Your expression makes a lasting impression."
2018015002	"Haven't you had enough?"
2018017000	"They call me Draakon Commander Lumikan."
2018017001	"Just don't think you can go ordering me around!"
2018017002	"I wasn't ready for that..."
2018017003	"Well, {UserName}, in search of Vergos' Legacy?"
2018017004	"{UserName}, what's next?"
2018017005	"{UserName}, what tidings do you bring?"
2018017006	"{UserName}, show your gratitude."
2018019000	"Elsewhere, they call it exploitation."
2018019001	"What gives you the right to show such cheek?"
2018019002	"If you crave great power, express yourself respectfully."
2018019003	"A break is always welcome."
2018019004	"I feel weak."
2018019005	"Aren't you hungry?"
2018020000	"Ohh!"
2018020001	"You want to try your hand at that?"
2018020002	"I want to lend it to you."
2018020003	"Well, do you feel anything yet?"
2018020010	"Are you up to it?"
2018020011	"This is only the beginning."
2018020012	"Yes, that's right! This is Draakon Force."
2018020020	"Unmistakable, isn't it?"
2018020021	"Oops."
2018020022	"Bah."
2018020030	"Ha, what a sight."
2018020031	"Now give it here!"
2018020032	"I'm waiting."
2018020040	"Nothing would get done without my intervention!"
2018020041	"So weak..."
2018020042	"You are gushing with gratitude!"
2018021000	"A dubious delight."
2018021001	"Are you having fun?"
2018021002	"You should strengthen yourself if you have the time."
2018021003	"What a waste..."
2018022000	"Are you waiting for the seven fairies or something?"
2018022001	"Something is stirring over there..."
2018022002	"Didn't you have breakfast?"
2018023000	"Don't let yourself go like that!"
2018023001	"Why all the concentration...?"
2018023002	"Hmm, lowly creatures wrestling with each other?"
2018024000	"There are the good-for-nothing lowlifes."
2018024001	"Is that for me?"
2018024002	"Give it all to me!"
2018024003	"I want it."
2018024004	"Give it here!"
2018025000	"Are you struggling all alone?"
2018025001	"Looking for allies?"
2018025002	"Are you on the right path?"
2018026000	"Are you going or not?"
2018026001	"All roads lead to success."
2018026002	"I'm keeping an eye on you."
2018026003	"Hehe, it'll be a rare treat to watch you."
2018027000	"I am not your flunky."
2018027001	"That was silly!"
2018027002	"There are useful and useless things in this land."
2018028000	"What are you messing with there?"
2018028001	"Those colors, very attractive."
2018028002	"For me?"
2018029000	"You look mighty satisfied."
2018029001	"Yes, a really splendid achievement."
2018029002	"Give it to me."
2018031000	"Such incredible power."
2018031001	"Finally, something useful."
2018031002	"There's hardly any progress to talk of here."
2018032000	"Another level stronger..."
2018032001	"We're not done yet."
2018032002	"You are still no match for a draakon."
2018033000	"Want to trade?"
2018033001	"Seems you've tasted Gold."
2018033002	"What do you want to spend your Gold on?"
2018034000	"That's what I call getting close to the draakon."
2018034001	"That's what I call perfectly shaped."
2018034002	"That's nothing to sneeze at."
2018034003	"You defended the honor of the draakons."
2018100000	"No HP potions... you must be out of your mind!"
2018100001	"You're out of HP potions. Are you tired of living?"
2018100002	"You're out of HP potions. Have you got an eye on your HP?"
2018100003	"You don't have any HP potions!"
2018100010	"Did you bring enough MP potions?"
2018100011	"I told you to pack MP potions!"
2018100012	"Did you leave your MP potions at home?"
2018100013	"What are you going to do without any MP potions?"
2018100020	"Are you forgetful or something?"
2018100021	"How do you picture doing this without MP potions?"
2018100022	"Is there anything you did remember?"
2018100023	"Prudence is the best insurance!"
2105300001	"This is for Elleon."
2105300002	"Feel my rage!"
2111000000	"I was still talking!"
2111000001	"I'm not finished yet!"
2111000002	"What...where...?"
2111000003	"You...left..."
2111000011	"Goodbye!"
2111000012	"Hello, there!"
2111000013	"How are you doing?"
2111000014	"Nothing special."
2111000015	"How is your master doing?"
2111000016	"The best master there could be!"
2111000017	"See you later."
2111000018	"See you next time!"
2111000021	"Is something troubling you?"
2111000022	"It feels like a long time since my master gave me a gift..."
2111000023	"Are you sure it isn't just you?"
2111000024	"Maybe..."
2111000025	"Take it easy!"
2111000026	"Hang in there!"
2111000027	"So long!"
2111000028	"See you!"
2111000031	"Have we met before?"
2111000032	"I don't think so?"
2111000033	"No! We've met!"
2111000034	"No. We didn't."
2111000035	"Do you like this, too?"
2111000036	"No, not really."
2111000037	"See you next time!"
2111000038	"Bye."
2111000041	"I'm so tired."
2111000042	"You should get some rest!"
2111000043	"I can't. My master is really busy these days."
2111000044	"Well, at least your master takes care of you."
2111000045	"But you really should rest."
2111000046	"I know. I'm more worried about my master."
2111000047	"Both of you should get some rest."
2111000048	"Thanks."
2111000051	"La la la!"
2111000052	"What are you so happy about?"
2111000053	"I think I'm getting better every day!"
2111000054	"That's great!"
2111000055	"Thanks! I hope you have some good news, too!"
2111000056	"I wish I did, too. Thanks."
2111000057	"Good luck!"
2111000058	"Bye."
2111010011	"Your master looks very busy."
2111010012	"Yes, and it's all thanks to my support!"
2111010013	"You don't have to be such a show-off."
2111010014	"I wasn't showing off, it's a fact!"
2111010015	"Just wait. My master will be like that sooner or later."
2111010016	"Sure, whatever."
2111010017	"Oh, you'll see."
2111010018	"Make me."
2111010021	"Cheers, for both of us."
2111010022	"Well said."
2111010023	"Um...what more can we do, though?"
2111010024	"Well...um...haha?"
2111010025	"Just do our best, whatever we do?"
2111010026	"Yes! That's it!"
2111010027	"Right! Good luck!"
2111010028	"You too!"
2111010031	"Hee-hee, your master looks so weak!"
2111010032	"What? Hey, level isn't everything that matters!"
2111010033	"No offense. I was just saying..."
2111010034	"You should watch your mouth!"
2111010035	"I won't forget you, you...!"
2111010036	"Oh, I'm so scared...!"
2111010037	"Laugh while you can..."
2111010038	"Oh, we'll see..."
2111010039	"That's higher than I expected!"
2111010040	"It didn't even take that long."
2111010041	"Your master should keep it up."
2111010042	"Mind your own business!"
2111010043	"Your master will get there before you even know it!"
2111010044	"Good luck."
2111010045	"You haven't seen the last of us."
2111010046	"I'll be waiting."
2111010047	"My master can do that!"
2111010048	"Really? Looks like your master worked hard!"
2111010049	"Of course!"
2111010050	"But I bet my master is stronger."
2111010051	"What do you mean? They're the same level."
2111010052	"Oh, you'll see what I mean."
2111010053	"I'll be waiting."
2111010054	"Aww...your master didn't level up yet?"
2111010055	"It won't take that long!"
2111010056	"Really?"
2111010057	"Of course! It's my master!"
2111010058	"There's nothing hard in leveling for a good master!"
2111010059	"How can you be so sure?"
2111010060	"Let's see when we meet again."
2111010061	"Oh yes, you'll see."
2111010062	"It's been a long time, but nothing has changed."
2111010063	"You've returned?"
2111010064	"What do you think?"
2111010065	"Not bad."
2111010066	"Everything kind of feels new to me..."
2111010067	"Hope we can see each other again."
2111010068	"I'll try."
2111010069	"You're back?"
2111010070	"Yes. It's been some time."
2111010071	"How have you been doing?"
2111010072	"I got closer with my master."
2111010073	"Did you get a present?"
2111010074	"My master gives me lots of stuff."
2111010075	"I should get going."
2111010076	"Already? Take care."
2111010077	"Long time, no see!"
2111010078	"Hey there!"
2111010079	"I hope we can see each other more often."
2111010080	"I'll try."
2111010081	"Let's talk once in a while."
2111010082	"I'd love to."
2111010083	"It was nice meeting you!"
2111010084	"Me too!"
2111010085	"Have you been busy?"
2111010086	"Not really."
2111010087	"It's so hard to catch up to you these days."
2111010088	"You missed me that much?"
2111010089	"Well...um...not that much."
2111010090	"I was just wondering if you were doing well."
2111010091	"I'd like to see you more often, too!"
2111010092	"Thanks."
2111010093	"Hey!"
2111010094	"How have you been doing?"
2111010095	"I'm always good."
2111010096	"Are you by yourself?"
2111010097	"Your master doesn't have a guild?"
2111010098	"I guess master likes it this way."
2111010099	"Master and I are really in to our guild."
2111010100	"Ah, I see. "
2111010101	"I'm so busy these days."
2111010102	"Why?"
2111010103	"Master is really committed to the guild."
2111010104	"That much?"
2111010105	"Master is committed to many things."
2111010106	"Isn't that hard on you?"
2111010107	"Not really."
2111010108	"Oh, okay."
2111010109	"I'm so bored!"
2111010110	"Anything fun going on?"
2111010111	"I don't know."
2111010112	"Master is looking for a guild."
2111010113	"Any guild in mind?"
2111010114	"That's why I'm worried."
2111010115	"I'm not sure if there's a guild good enough for my master."
2111010116	"I understand."
2111010117	"Have we met?"
2111010118	"Of course! Our masters are in the same guild!"
2111010119	"Have you met any other companions?"
2111010120	"Not that I remember."
2111010121	"I'll make sure to remember you."
2111010122	"Thanks! "
2111010123	"Remember me the next time we meet!"
2111010124	"Of course I will."
2111010125	"Hi!"
2111010126	"What is your guild like?"
2111010127	"Not bad."
2111010128	"Is everyone nice?"
2111010129	"I think so."
2111010130	"My guild isn't so bad either."
2111010131	"Let's make our guild great!"
2111010132	"Let's!"
2111010133	"I'm so tired!"
2111010134	"Is something wrong?"
2111010135	"I've been so busy lately."
2111010136	"You should get some rest!"
2111010137	"Doesn't your master take care of you?"
2111010138	"Of course! I was just busy!"
2111010139	"Okay, go get some rest."
2111010140	"I will!"
2111010141	"Someone looks happy!"
2111010142	"It's not a big deal."
2111010143	"Did you get a present?"
2111010144	"How did you know?"
2111010145	"You have a big smile in your eyes."
2111010146	"Hee hee, presents always make me happy."
2111010147	"You'll get one too!"
2111010148	"Thanks."
2111010149	"How are you doing?"
2111010150	"Not so bad."
2111010151	"But you look like something's wrong."
2111010152	"Everything's fine."
2111010153	"Oh, are you not getting presents?"
2111010154	"No! It's nothing like that!"
2111010155	"I hope so."
2111010156	"Go on!"
2111010157	"Hey, {ContactServantName}!"
2111010158	"{ContactServantName}!"
2111010159	"How is it with {ContactUserName}?"
2111010160	"Nothing special."
2111010161	"{UserName} is the best!"
2111010162	"Not as much as {UserName}!"
2111010163	"Bye, {ContactServantName}!"
2111010164	"See you, {ContactServantName}!"
2111010165	"{ContactUserName}'s equipment looks fantastic!"
2111010166	"Of course! {ContactUserName} has {EquipmentItemLevel} level gear!"
2111010167	"My master has...{EquipmentItemLevel} gear? Look at that!"
2111010168	"What a coincidence!"
2111010169	"Heh? Is your master's item level still {ContactEquipmentItemLevel}?"
2111010170	"It...it won't take long to upgrade!"
2111010171	"Your master is {ContactUserLevel}...?"
2111010172	"Hehe, {UserLevel} was a piece of cake!"
2111010173	"Eh? My master is {UserLevel}!"
2111010174	"Aww...I thought my master would be higher..."
2111010175	"My master is {UserLevel}!"
2111010176	"You don't need to brag about it!"
2111010177	"Your master is only {ContactUserLevel}?"
2111010178	"Yeah, like {ContactUserLevel} is a big deal..."
2111010179	"{ContactUserName}'s guild is {ContactGuildName}?"
2111010180	"Yup! Interested?"
2111010181	"My master is a core member of the guild {GuildName}!"
2111010182	"Ah, I see."
2111010183	"Good luck today, {ContactServantName}!"
2111010184	"You too, {ContactServantName}!"
2111010185	"Your master's guild is {GuildName}?"
2111010186	"Yes! Nice to meet you!"
2111010187	"How are things going at {ContactGuildName}?"
2111010188	"Splendid! Thanks to {UserName} of course!"
2111010189	"{GuildName} is the best though!"
2111010190	"Not without {UserName}, they aren't!"
2111010191	"Wow! Your fellowship is already {ContactBuffGrade}?"
2111010192	"I know, right?"
2111010193	"I'm only {BuffGrade}."
2111010194	"Keep up the work!"
2111010195	"I didn't know I was {BuffGrade} already!"
2111010196	"That's the same level with me!"
2111010197	"You're {BuffGrade} too, {ContactServantName}?"
2111010198	"Yup!"
2111010199	"Eh? Your fellowship is only {ContactBuffGrade}?"
2111010200	"It'll improve!"
2111010201	"What? Your fellowship is {BuffGrade}...?"
2111010202	"Do you have a problem with that?"
2112000000	"Enough talking..."
2112000001	"How rude! Leaving in the middle of a conversation!"
2112000002	"Huh? Where are you?"
2112000003	"Where did you go...?"
2112000011	"Hello!"
2112000012	"Glad to see you!"
2112000013	"You're looking great!"
2112000014	"I always do!"
2112000015	"Your master looks awesome!"
2112000016	"I know, right?"
2112000017	"See you again!"
2112000018	"It was nice meeting you!"
2112000021	"Is something worrying you?"
2112000022	"Master won't give me a gift..."
2112000023	"I'm sure your master just forgot. You'll get one soon!"
2112000024	"I hope so..."
2112000025	"He will! So chin up!"
2112000026	"Thanks!"
2112000027	"Take it easy. Bye!"
2112000028	"Bye!"
2112000031	"Hey, we've met before!"
2112000032	"Did we?"
2112000033	"Yes! We met in Velika!"
2112000034	"...we did?"
2112000035	"What do you think about this gift?"
2112000036	"Uh...um..."
2112000037	"Promise me you'll remember next time!"
2112000038	"I'll try! So long!"
2112000041	"I'm so tired!"
2112000042	"You look exhausted! Are you alright?"
2112000043	"Thanks for asking. My master has been very busy lately."
2112000044	"Well, that's a good thing!"
2112000045	"But you still need some rest!"
2112000046	"I do, don't I?"
2112000047	"Of course! Tell your master to take a break from time to time."
2112000048	"I will. Thanks!"
2112000051	"Yay!"
2112000052	"You look so happy!"
2112000053	"I found a gift that I thought I'd lost."
2112000054	"Congratulations!"
2112000055	"I know, right?"
2112000056	"Thanks! You're so nice!"
2112000057	"Bye!"
2112000058	"It was nice meeting you!"
2112010011	"Your master looks very busy!"
2112010012	"Yes, and so am I!"
2112010013	"Aren't you kind of bragging right now?"
2112010014	"I wasn't showing off; I am busy!"
2112010015	"All right, I'll get busy myself!"
2112010016	"That's the spirit!"
2112010017	"You'll see!"
2112010018	"Good luck!"
2112010021	"Cheers, for both of us."
2112010022	"Wow! You're the same level as your master?"
2112010023	"How did you do it?"
2112010024	"Well, you know...!"
2112010025	"Just keep on going. Consistency is all that matters!"
2112010026	"Right! That's it!"
2112010027	"Good luck!"
2112010028	"Thanks!"
2112010031	"Shouldn't your master work harder?"
2112010032	"How dare you talk like that to my master!"
2112010033	"Equipment is all that matters."
2112010034	"You better stop that trash talk!"
2112010035	"I won't forget this!"
2112010036	"Yeah, right...!"
2112010037	"I mean it!"
2112010038	"Yeah, yeah."
2112010039	"Your level is impressive!"
2112010040	"Ha ha, it's nothing to brag about."
2112010041	"You should be working hard."
2112010042	"I already am!"
2112010043	"It won't take long!"
2112010044	"Well, good luck!"
2112010045	"The next time we meet, you'll see."
2112010046	"I hope that day comes soon."
2112010047	"Are you the same level as your master?"
2112010048	"You've been working hard!"
2112010049	"Yes. I have!"
2112010050	"But my master is stronger."
2112010051	"What do you mean? You're the same level."
2112010052	"Oh, you'll see what I mean."
2112010053	"Oh, yeah, right."
2112010054	"Your level is quite low."
2112010055	"I'm doing my best!"
2112010056	"I bet you could try a little harder."
2112010057	"Will you stop?"
2112010058	"I'll level up so fast, it'll be a blur!"
2112010059	"Ha ha, I hope you do."
2112010060	"I look forward to seeing you again."
2112010061	"So do I."
2112010062	"You haven't changed a bit."
2112010063	"You're back!"
2112010064	"So, how do you feel?"
2112010065	"Not so bad."
2112010066	"Going new places; seeing new things."
2112010067	"We should meet up more often."
2112010068	"Yes, we should!"
2112010069	"What took you so long to come see me?"
2112010070	"Yes, it has been a while."
2112010071	"How are you?"
2112010072	"Fine. I've become closer with my master."
2112010073	"Looks like someone got a lot of gifts!"
2112010074	"Yes, my master has been very generous."
2112010075	"I see! Well, I have to get going."
2112010076	"Already? That's a shame. So long!"
2112010077	"It's been such a long time!"
2112010078	"Greetings!"
2112010079	"I hope we see each other more often."
2112010080	"I'll try."
2112010081	"Let's say ""Hey!"" once in a while."
2112010082	"Okay! Don't be a stranger."
2112010083	"It's nice seeing you!"
2112010084	"You, too!"
2112010085	"Have you been busy?"
2112010086	"Not really."
2112010087	"It's so hard to connect with friends these days."
2112010088	"Aw, did you miss me?"
2112010089	"Well...um...not that much."
2112010090	"I was just wondering how you've been doing."
2112010091	"I wish we ran into you more often!"
2112010092	"With a car? Oh!"
2112010093	"Hello."
2112010094	"How are you doing?"
2112010095	"Good. As always."
2112010096	"Are you by yourself?"
2112010097	"My master seems to have no interest in the guild."
2112010098	"Is that bad?"
2112010099	"My master is a very active member."
2112010100	"I see."
2112010101	"I'm so busy these days."
2112010102	"Busy with what?"
2112010103	"My master is a very active guild member."
2112010104	"That sound exhausting."
2112010105	"My master is always deeply into everything."
2112010106	"That would make you very busy."
2112010107	"Nothing I can't handle."
2112010108	"I see."
2112010109	"I'm bored."
2112010110	"Anything fun happening?"
2112010111	"I don't know."
2112010112	"My master is looking for a guild."
2112010113	"Any recommendations?"
2112010114	"Well..."
2112010115	"It's hard to find the right guild."
2112010116	"Yes, that's the problem."
2112010117	"Have we met before?"
2112010118	"We have. Our masters are in the same guild."
2112010119	"Have you met any others?"
2112010120	"I do, once in a while."
2112010121	"But it's especially nice to see you."
2112010122	"Aww, thanks!"
2112010123	"Please say ""Hi!"" the next time we meet."
2112010124	"I will! "
2112010125	"Hello."
2112010126	"What's your guild like?"
2112010127	"I think it's fine."
2112010128	"Is everyone good?"
2112010129	"Yes, they always help each other out."
2112010130	"My guild isn't so bad either."
2112010131	"We're trying to do our best."
2112010132	"Keep up the good work, then!"
2112010133	"I'm a bit tired."
2112010134	"Is something wrong?"
2112010135	"Nothing in particular."
2112010136	"You need some rest."
2112010137	"Doesn't your master care about you?"
2112010138	"Yes, just a bit busy these days."
2112010139	"You should take a nap."
2112010140	"Thank you."
2112010141	"You look excited."
2112010142	"Ha ha, it's nothing special."
2112010143	"Did you get a gift?"
2112010144	"How did you know?"
2112010145	"You look happier than I've ever seen."
2112010146	"Well, presents always make me happy."
2112010147	"I bet you'll get one too!"
2112010148	"I hope so."
2112010149	"How have you been doing?"
2112010150	"Not so bad."
2112010151	"You seem worried."
2112010152	"Everything's fine."
2112010153	"Isn't your master giving you gifts?"
2112010154	"No. My master always gives me gifts!"
2112010155	"I hope so."
2112010156	"It's true."
2112010157	"Hello, {ContactServantName}!"
2112010158	"Greetings, {ContactServantName}!"
2112010159	"Is everything all right, {ContactUserName}?"
2112010160	"Yep."
2112010161	"{UserName} is the best!"
2112010162	"Not as much as {UserName}, I bet."
2112010163	"Farewell, {ContactServantName}!"
2112010164	"It was nice seeing you, {ContactServantName}!"
2112010165	"That's some nice gear {ContactUserName} has."
2112010166	"I know. They're level {EquipmentItemLevel}."
2112010167	"Level {EquipmentItemLevel}? That's the same with my master."
2112010168	"Really? What a coincidence!"
2112010169	"Is your master's equipment still level {ContactEquipmentItemLevel}?"
2112010170	"My master needs to enchant. That's all."
2112010171	"Your master is level {ContactUserLevel}?"
2112010172	"Level {UserLevel} is a piece of cake!"
2112010173	"Your master is level {UserLevel}?"
2112010174	"Yes, you're the same level."
2112010175	"My master is level {UserLevel}."
2112010176	"You don't need to brag about it."
2112010177	"Your master is only level {ContactUserLevel}?"
2112010178	"Lucky you, your master is level {ContactUserLevel}."
2112010179	"{ContactUserName} is in the guild {ContactGuildName}?"
2112010180	"Yes. Are you interested in joining?"
2112010181	"My master is very big in our guild, {GuildName}."
2112010182	"Ha ha, I see."
2112010183	"Good luck today, {ContactServantName}!"
2112010184	"You too, {ContactServantName}!"
2112010185	"Your master is with the guild {GuildName}?"
2112010186	"Yes! Nice to meet you!"
2112010187	"How is {ContactGuildName}?"
2112010188	"For {UserName}, it's the best guild in the land!"
2112010189	"{UserName}'s guild, {GuildName}, is the best guild without doubt."
2112010190	"{UserName}'s guild is the best there is!"
2112010191	"Wow! Your fellowship is already {ContactBuffGrade}?"
2112010192	"Ha ha, impressive, isn't it?"
2112010193	"I'm only at fellowship {BuffGrade}."
2112010194	"Don't worry. You'll get there."
2112010195	"My fellowship is {BuffGrade}."
2112010196	"So am I."
2112010197	"You've reached fellowship {BuffGrade} too, {ContactServantName}?"
2112010198	"Yes."
2112010199	"Your fellowship is only {ContactBuffGrade}?"
2112010200	"It'll improve!"
2112010201	"What? Your fellowship is {BuffGrade}?"
2112010202	"Stop being such a show off."
2113000000	"You'll see!"
2113000001	"Where did you go...? Oh, well...bye!"
2113000002	"What? Where...did...?"
2113000003	"Huh? Where are you?"
2113000011	"Goodbye!"
2113000012	"Nice to see you!"
2113000013	"What are you so happy about?"
2113000014	"I'm always happy!"
2113000015	"Does your master give you gifts often?"
2113000016	"Yes! That's what keeps me so happy!"
2113000017	"Goodbye."
2113000018	"Farewell!"
2113000021	"Is something bothering you?"
2113000022	"I'm not getting that many gifts anymore..."
2113000023	"No! That couldn't be!"
2113000024	"I wish..."
2113000025	"I'm sure it's temporary! Cheer up!"
2113000026	"Thanks, I will."
2113000027	"Chin up! Bye."
2113000028	"Bye!"
2113000031	"It's you again!"
2113000032	"We've met before?"
2113000033	"I think so!"
2113000034	"Are you sure?"
2113000035	"Do you want to take a look at this?"
2113000036	"What is it? It looks good!"
2113000037	"Promise me you'll remember next time!"
2113000038	"I will! Bye!"
2113000041	"I'm so exhausted!"
2113000042	"Are you alright?"
2113000043	"I just got so many things to do lately."
2113000044	"But that's better then doing nothing, right?"
2113000045	"All you need is a little rest."
2113000046	"I think you're right!"
2113000047	"Good. Take it easy."
2113000048	"Okay, I will."
2113000051	"Yay!"
2113000052	"You're looking great!"
2113000053	"I had two snacks today!"
2113000054	"Wow! You're so lucky!"
2113000055	"You'll be lucky someday, too!"
2113000056	"Thanks!"
2113000057	"Have a nice day!"
2113000058	"Goodbye."
2113010011	"How is your master so strong?"
2113010012	"Well, that would be because of me!"
2113010013	"Are you disrespecting me?"
2113010014	"Whoa, watch your temper!"
2113010015	"You'll see! My master will get strong too!"
2113010016	"You'll need to work hard!"
2113010017	"You'll see!"
2113010018	"I hope we meet again!"
2113010021	"I'll reach the same level as my master!"
2113010022	"Aim high!"
2113010023	"So...what should we do first?"
2113010024	"Well, um...any ideas?"
2113010025	"We'll figure it out...right!?"
2113010026	"We will! For sure!"
2113010027	"Yay!"
2113010028	"Good luck!"
2113010031	"Why is your level still so low?"
2113010032	"How dare you! Rude!"
2113010033	"You know that level is all that counts, right?"
2113010034	"Urgh! I hate you!"
2113010035	"I'll never forget what you said!"
2113010036	"Ha ha!"
2113010037	"You'll pay for this!"
2113010038	"Hah! I hope I do. See you next time!"
2113010039	"Your master's level is impressive!"
2113010040	"Ha ha, it didn't take that long to reach."
2113010041	"You should try to level up."
2113010042	"We always do!"
2113010043	"We'll catch up in no time!"
2113010044	"So long."
2113010045	"The next time we meet, you'll see."
2113010046	"I'll look forward to that."
2113010047	"You're the same level as your master?"
2113010048	"Wow. You've been working hard, haven't you?"
2113010049	"Hee hee, master and I always give it our best."
2113010050	"But my master is stronger."
2113010051	"What do you mean? You're the same level."
2113010052	"My master and I will get stronger still!"
2113010053	"Good luck!"
2113010054	"Your level is still a bit low."
2113010055	"I'll catch up!"
2113010056	"You should work a little harder."
2113010057	"That's enough!"
2113010058	"Leveling up isn't so hard!"
2113010059	"You seem confident."
2113010060	"I hope you've improved the next time we meet."
2113010061	"You'll see! Goodbye!"
2113010062	"It's been such a long time! You haven't changed a bit!"
2113010063	"Oh, you've returned?"
2113010064	"How does it feel to be back?"
2113010065	"Not bad. Not bad at all."
2113010066	"It's like starting all over again."
2113010067	"I hope to see you more often."
2113010068	"Me too!"
2113010069	"You're back!"
2113010070	"I know, it's been a while."
2113010071	"How is everything?"
2113010072	"Good! I've become closer with my master!"
2113010073	"Looks like you've had a lot of presents!"
2113010074	"Yep, my master is always thinking about me."
2113010075	"You're so lucky! I have to go now."
2113010076	"Already? Good bye."
2113010077	"Goodness! It's been such a long time!"
2113010078	"Hi!"
2113010079	"Why don't we see you more often?"
2113010080	"I don't know. I'll try to come around more."
2113010081	"At least say ""Hey!"" once in a while."
2113010082	"Yes, okay."
2113010083	"It was nice chatting with you!"
2113010084	"Yes, for me too!"
2113010085	"Have you been busy?"
2113010086	"No, not terribly."
2113010087	"But it's so hard to catch up to you these days."
2113010088	"Aww. You missed me?"
2113010089	"Well...um...not that much."
2113010090	"I was just wondering how you've been doing."
2113010091	"I'd like to see you more often!"
2113010092	"I know, me too."
2113010093	"Hi!"
2113010094	"Hi! Is everything all right?"
2113010095	"Yup! I'm always good."
2113010096	"Where's your master?"
2113010097	"Doesn't your master like guilds?"
2113010098	"Well...I guess so..."
2113010099	"My master has a guild."
2113010100	"I see."
2113010101	"I'm so busy!"
2113010102	"Why?"
2113010103	"My master is a very active guild member."
2113010104	"That's a surprise!"
2113010105	"My master is very energetic."
2113010106	"That must be hard for you."
2113010107	"I'm always relaxed!"
2113010108	"Okay..."
2113010109	"I'm so bored!"
2113010110	"Anything fun going on?"
2113010111	"I don't think there is."
2113010112	"My master is looking for a guild these days."
2113010113	"Any guild in mind?"
2113010114	"Hmm..."
2113010115	"Do you think there's a guild for my master?"
2113010116	"That's hard to say..."
2113010117	"Have we met before?"
2113010118	"Our masters are in the same guild!"
2113010119	"Have you met other companions?"
2113010120	"I'm not sure."
2113010121	"But I'll remember you for sure!"
2113010122	"Thanks! So will I!"
2113010123	"Let's say hi again next time."
2113010124	"Of course!"
2113010125	"Hi!"
2113010126	"How are things going at your guild?"
2113010127	"Everything's fine!"
2113010128	"Everyone is nice."
2113010129	"They are!"
2113010130	"My guild isn't so bad either."
2113010131	"Let's make a difference in our guilds!"
2113010132	"Okay!"
2113010133	"I'm so tired!"
2113010134	"What's wrong?"
2113010135	"I've been so busy lately."
2113010136	"What you need is some rest!"
2113010137	"Doesn't your master care for you?"
2113010138	"No! No...my master is busy...that's all."
2113010139	"Go get some rest!"
2113010140	"Okay, I will."
2113010141	"You're looking great!"
2113010142	"Hee hee, am I?"
2113010143	"Did you get a gift?"
2113010144	"How did you know?"
2113010145	"Yyou look very pleased!"
2113010146	"Well, presents always make me happy."
2113010147	"You'll probably get one too!"
2113010148	"I hope so!"
2113010149	"Hi! Is everything all right?"
2113010150	"Well, I guess so."
2113010151	"Is something wrong?"
2113010152	"No..."
2113010153	"Ah, aren't you getting presents?"
2113010154	"No! I'm getting one nearly every day!"
2113010155	"Sure you are."
2113010156	"Stop being mean!"
2113010157	"Hey, {ContactServantName}!"
2113010158	"Hi, {ContactServantName}!"

2113010166	"My master's item level is {EquipmentItemLevel}!"
2113010167	"{EquipmentItemLevel}? My master's item level is {EquipmentItemLevel} too!"
2113010168	"Really? What are the odds!"
2113010169	"Is your master's item level still {ContactEquipmentItemLevel}?"
2113010170	"Item level {ContactEquipmentItemLevel} won't take so long."
2113010171	"Is your master already {ContactUserLevel}?"
2113010172	"Yup! Level {UserLevel} was a piece of cake!"
2113010173	"Wow! Is your master level {UserLevel} too?"
2113010174	"Yes. My master has been busy leveling up!"
2113010175	"My master is level {UserLevel}!"
2113010176	"You don't need to brag about it!"
2113010177	"Your master is only level {ContactUserLevel}?"
2113010178	"My master will get to level {ContactUserLevel} in no time!"
2113010179	"Is {ContactUserName} in the guild {ContactGuildName}?"
2113010180	"Yes. Are you interested in joining?"

2113010187	"How's your guild {ContactGuildName}?"
2113010188	"With {UserName} in it, it's the best!"
2113010189	"With my master in it, {GuildName} is the best guild there is!"
2113010190	"Without {UserName}, no guild can be the best!"
2113010191	"Wow! Your fellowship is {ContactBuffGrade}?"
2113010192	"I'm impressed by it, too!"
2113010193	"Lucky you. I'm only at fellowship {BuffGrade}."
2113010194	"It's not luck, you should work harder!"
2113010195	"My fellowship is {BuffGrade}!"
2113010196	"Really? Me too!"
2113010197	"Wow! Is your fellowship {BuffGrade}, {ContactServantName}?"

2113010201	"What? Your fellowship is {BuffGrade}...?"
2113010202	"Stop picking on me!"
2114000000	"Bye bye!"
2114000001	"Just left?"
2114000002	"Gone?"
2114000003	"Where are you?"
2114000011	"Hello!"

2114000018	"Farewell!"
2114000021	"What's up?"
2114000022	"I'm not getting that many gifts anymore..."
2114000023	"I'm sure it's only temporary!"
2114000024	"Maybe?"
2114000025	"Cheer up!"
2114000026	"Chin up!"
2114000027	"Goodbye."
2114000028	"Thank you! Goodbye."
2114000031	"We've met before, haven't we?"
2114000032	"I don't remember you."
2114000033	"We've met, right?"
2114000034	"Nope."
2114000035	"Wanna see the gift I got?"
2114000036	"That seems very useful."
2114000037	"Farewell!"
2114000038	"Goodbye."
2114000041	"I need sleep... "
2114000042	"Take a little nap."
2114000043	"We're getting busier."
2114000044	"Overworking isn't good for you."
2114000045	"Take it easy."
2114000046	"Got it!"
2114000047	"Good."
2114000048	"Thank you!"
2114000051	"Hee hee!"
2114000052	"What's good?"
2114000053	"This flower just bloomed!"

2114000055	"Thank you! Good Luck!"
2114000056	"Thanks!"
2114000057	"Have a good day!"

2114010013	"Aww..."
2114010014	"Anything wrong?"
2114010015	"Well done!"
2114010016	"Work hard!"
2114010017	"Change is easy!"
2114010018	"Work hard!"
2114010021	"Look! Our Masters are the same level."
2114010022	"Yes."
2114010023	"What shall I do?"
2114010024	"La la la!"
2114010025	"Treat 'em like a fragile flower..."
2114010026	"Aww... yes!"
2114010027	"Let's do it!"
2114010028	"And, cheer up!"
2114010031	"Is your item level still low?"
2114010032	"That's mean!..."
2114010033	"I didn't mean to!"
2114010034	"That was frustrating!"
2114010035	"I won't forget!"
2114010036	"Just a misunderstanding..."
2114010037	"Laugh while you can..."
2114010038	"No offense. I was just saying..."
2114010039	"Wow! How is your master's level so high!?"
2114010040	"It's all hard work."
2114010041	"Your master can easily catch up with hard work."
2114010042	"We are doing our best!"
2114010043	"It won't take long!"
2114010044	"Hard work is everything!"
2114010045	"Getting stronger!"
2114010046	"I'll look forward to it."
2114010047	"Is your master the same level?"
2114010048	"Working hard?"

2114010055	"We'll level up soon!"
2114010056	"Keep up!"
2114010057	"You're doing well!"
2114010058	"We'll level up so fast, we'll be a blur!"
2114010059	"Wow! What confidence!"
2114010060	"I'll definitely check back."
2114010061	"Yes, please check back."
2114010062	"Long time no see!"

2114010064	"How are you?"
2114010065	"That's great!"
2114010066	"That's something new."

2114010085	"Were you busy?"
2114010086	"Not really."
2114010087	"It is a rare opportunity to see you."
2114010088	"Have you missed me?"
2114010089	"Ahh..."
2114010090	"I was just wondering how you've been doing."
2114010091	"Hope to see you again, soon."
2114010092	"Good!"
2114010093	"Hello!"
2114010094	"How are you doing?"
2114010095	"It's been great!"
2114010096	"Alone?"
2114010097	"Is your master interested in guilds?"
2114010098	"We seem to be okay as is."
2114010099	"My master is a guild member."
2114010100	"Is that so?"
2114010101	"So many things to to."
2114010102	"What are you up to?"
2114010103	"My master is busy with guild activities these days."
2114010104	"That's a surprise!"
2114010105	"My master really gets into these things."
2114010106	"That must be tough."
2114010107	"I like it this way."
2114010108	"I see."
2114010109	"It's boring."
2114010110	"Anything fun going on?"
2114010111	"I don't know."
2114010112	"I'm looking for a guild for my master."
2114010113	"Do you have a guild to recommend?"
2114010114	"There are so many."
2114010115	"They need to be good for my master."
2114010116	"I understand."
2114010117	"Have we met before?"
2114010118	"Our masters are in the same guild."
2114010119	"Have you met any other companions?"
2114010120	"I don't remember."
2114010121	"I always remember."
2114010122	"I'm glad!"
2114010123	"Remember me the next time we meet!"
2114010124	"That should be easy."
2114010125	"Hello!"
2114010126	"What's your guild like?"
2114010127	"Seems good."
2114010128	"You all care for each other."
2114010129	"Everyone is so nice."
2114010130	"It isn't so bad."
2114010131	"All we can do is our best."
2114010132	"We do our best."
2114010133	"I'm so tired."
2114010134	"What's up?"
2114010135	"We've been busy."
2114010136	"You should get some rest!"
2114010137	"Doesn't your master take care of you?"
2114010138	"My master was super busy."
2114010139	"Have a good rest."
2114010140	"Got it!"
2114010141	"Anything good happening?"
2114010142	"That's a secret."
2114010143	"Looks like someone got a gift!"
2114010144	"How did you know?"
2114010145	"Having fun."
2114010146	"Presents make me happy!"
2114010147	"I bet you'll get one, too!"
2114010148	"Thanks!"
2114010149	"How are you doing?"
2114010150	"Not bad."
2114010151	"Are you upset?"
2114010152	"Nope."
2114010153	"Isn't your master giving you gifts?"
2114010154	"No! Nope!"
2114010155	"Okay then..."
2114010156	"Stop rubbing it in."
2114010157	"{ContactServantName}! Hi!"
2114010158	"Nice to meet you, {ContactServantName}!"
2114010159	"How is {ContactUserName} doing?"

2114010165	"Is {ContactUserName}'s gear that good? "
2114010166	"It is level {EquipmentItemLevel}!"
2114010167	"Your master's gear is level {EquipmentItemLevel}?"
2114010168	"What a coincidence!"
2114010169	"Heh? Is your master's item level still {ContactEquipmentItemLevel}?"
2114010170	"We'll improve it soon!"
2114010171	"Your master is level {ContactUserLevel}...?"
2114010172	"Level {UserLevel} is a piece of cake!"
2114010173	"Wow! Our masters are both {UserLevel}!"
2114010174	"I thought it was a higher level..."
2114010175	"My master is level {UserLevel}!"
2114010176	"Don't be so boasting."
2114010177	"Heh? Your master is only {ContactUserLevel}? "
2114010178	"Lucky you, your master is level {ContactUserLevel}."
2114010179	"{ContactUserName} is in the guild {ContactGuildName}?"
2114010180	"Interested?"
2114010181	"My master is an important member of the guild {GuildName}!"

2114010188	"Splendid! Thanks to {UserName} of course!"
2114010189	"{GuildName} is the best since my master is a member."
2114010190	"How can it be any good without {UserName}?"
2114010191	"Wow! Your fellowship is already {ContactBuffGrade}?"
2114010192	"Hee hee. I'm good at that!"
2114010193	"My fellowship is only {BuffGrade}..."
2114010194	"Don't worry!"
2114010195	"My fellowship is {BuffGrade}."
2114010196	"Our fellowships are the same!"
2114010197	"{ContactServantName}! Is your fellowship {BuffGrade}?"
2114010198	"Yeah, something like that."

2114010200	"I'll catch up!"
2114010201	"Is yours still {BuffGrade}?"
2114010202	"Stop being such a show off."
2115000011	"Good to see you, as always."
2115000012	"Glad to see you!"
2115000013	"How are you?"
2115000014	"Doing great!"

2115000018	"It was nice seeing you!"
2115000021	"Any problems?"
2115000022	"It's been too long since I got a present."
2115000023	"Your master must have forgotten. Wait a little bit."
2115000024	"I think so, too."
2115000025	"Cheer up!"
2115000026	"I will!"
2115000027	"Bye!"
2115000028	"Thanks! Bye bye!"
2115000031	"Hey, we've met before!"
2115000032	"Did...we?"
2115000033	"For sure!"
2115000034	"I think there's some misunderstanding."
2115000035	"Like the gift?"
2115000036	"It looks nice."
2115000037	"Promise you'll remember next time!"
2115000038	"Goodbye!"
2115000041	"Tired..."
2115000042	"You look tired."
2115000043	"I was busy."
2115000044	"Don't overdo it."
2115000045	"You should get some rest!"
2115000046	"I should, shouldn't I?"
2115000047	"Resting is important."
2115000048	"Thank you so much!"
2115000051	"Doing great!"
2115000052	"Good news?"
2115000053	"It is our new gear!"
2115000054	"It looks nice."
2115000055	"Feeling great."
2115000056	"Thank you!"
2115000057	"Bye!"
2115000058	"It was nice seeing you!"
2115010011	"My master is very energetic."
2115010012	"I'm helping a lot."
2115010013	"Okay...sure..."
2115010014	"I'm telling the truth!"
2115010015	"It's training time!"
2115010016	"Keep up!"
2115010017	"Change isn't hard!"
2115010018	"Keep up!"
2115010021	"Our masters are the same level?"
2115010022	"Is that so?"
2115010023	"Do you know what to do next?"
2115010024	"Hmm... no?"
2115010025	"Don't skip training."
2115010026	"That's it!"
2115010027	"Keep looking up!"
2115010028	"Work hard!"
2115010031	"Aww.. Are you still at that gear level?"
2115010032	"Rude!"
2115010033	"Item level is a very important thing."
2115010034	"Duels are always welcome."
2115010035	"I will never forget!"
2115010036	"Got it."
2115010037	"Let's see what you'll say next time!"
2115010038	"Got it."
2115010039	"High level?"
2115010040	"Yes, it is."
2115010041	"It's easy to catch up."
2115010042	"Trying is enough."
2115010043	"We'll catch up soon!"
2115010044	"Keep up!"
2115010045	"Your efforts will never let you down!"
2115010046	"Looking forward to it."
2115010047	"Our masters are the same level."
2115010048	"Working hard?"
2115010049	"Yes."
2115010050	"My master looks a bit stronger."
2115010051	"I don't think so."
2115010052	"We'll see."
2115010053	"Let's see."
2115010054	"Still that level?"
2115010055	"We'll catch up soon."
2115010056	"Try hard."
2115010057	"We always work hard!"
2115010058	"I believe you'll catch up soon."
2115010059	"So confident?"
2115010060	"We'll see next time."
2115010061	"Good. We'll see next time."
2115010062	"It's been a while."
2115010063	"Back again?"
2115010064	"How do you like it?"
2115010065	"It's great to be back."
2115010066	"Refreshing."
2115010067	"I hope we see each other more often."
2115010068	"See you soon."
2115010069	"What took you so long to come see me?"
2115010070	"It's been a while."
2115010071	"How have you been doing?"
2115010072	"Master and I keep getting closer."
2115010073	"And taking good care of you?"
2115010074	"Yes! I'm so thankful!"
2115010075	"Oh, I see. See you!"
2115010076	"Bye!"
2115010077	"It's been a while."
2115010078	"Glad to see you!"
2115010079	"Hope to see you soon."
2115010080	"We'll try."
2115010081	"I hope we see each other more often."
2115010082	"Sounds delightful."
2115010083	"It was nice seeing you!"
2115010084	"It was nice seeing you!"
2115010085	"Have you been busy?"
2115010086	"Not really."
2115010087	"Haven't seen you recently."
2115010088	"Were you looking for me?"
2115010089	"Hmmm..."
2115010090	"I was just asking."
2115010091	"I'd like to see each other more often."
2115010092	"Of course! We should!"
2115010093	"Hello!"
2115010094	"How are you doing?"
2115010095	"Doing well."
2115010096	"Alone?"
2115010097	"Your master isn't interested in guilds?"
2115010098	"I don't know."
2115010099	"My master is a guild member."
2115010100	"Is that so?"
2115010101	"It's been hectic recently."
2115010102	"What happened?"
2115010103	"My master is too into guild activities."
2115010104	"What do you mean?"
2115010105	"My master is always doing the best of the best."
2115010106	"That doesn't sound that good."
2115010107	"I have some leisure time."
2115010108	"Well, that's good!"
2115010109	"Bored..."
2115010110	"Anything fun happening?"
2115010111	"Nothing special."
2115010112	"Is your master looking for a guild?"
2115010113	"Do you have any recommendations?"
2115010114	"Dunno..."
2115010115	"I'm not sure if there's a right guild for my master."
2115010116	"Yes, that's the problem."
2115010117	"Have we met before?"
2115010118	"Our masters are in the same guild."
2115010119	"Have you met anyone else in the guild?"
2115010120	"Not that I remember."
2115010121	"It's great to meet on a day like today."
2115010122	"Thank you!"
2115010123	"Let's say hi again next time."
2115010124	"Sure!"
2115010125	"Hello!"
2115010126	"What's your guild like?"
2115010127	"I think it's fine."
2115010128	"Does everyone get along?"
2115010129	"I think so."
2115010130	"Our guild is good, too."
2115010131	"Everyone should try to do their best."
2115010132	"That's the spirit!"
2115010133	"I'm a bit tired."
2115010134	"What happened?"
2115010135	"So busy..."
2115010136	"You should rest."
2115010137	"Does your master ever take a break?"
2115010138	"It's... not like that. It was temporary."
2115010139	"A nap might help."
2115010140	"Thank you."
2115010141	"Get anything good?"
2115010142	"Nothing special."
2115010143	"Did you get a present?"
2115010144	"How did you know?"
2115010145	"You are acting so obvious."
2115010146	"It's a long-awaited gift."
2115010147	"You'll get one soon, I bet."
2115010148	"That makes me happy just thinking about it."
2115010149	"How are you doing?"
2115010150	"So so."
2115010151	"What happened?"
2115010152	"Nothing."
2115010153	"Haven't you received any gifts recently?"
2115010154	"No! Everything's fine!"
2115010155	"If you say so..."
2115010156	"You are being rude."
2115010157	"Greetings! {ContactServantName}!"
2115010158	"Greetings, {ContactServantName}!"
2115010159	"Is everything all right, {ContactUserName}?"
2115010160	"Doing great."
2115010161	"{UserName} is the best!"
2115010162	"Not as great as {UserName}, I bet."
2115010163	"{ContactServantName}! Goodbye!"
2115010164	"{ContactServantName}! It's nice seeing you!"
2115010165	"That's some nice gear {ContactUserName} has."
2115010166	"It is level {EquipmentItemLevel}."
2115010167	"My master's item is also level {EquipmentItemLevel}."
2115010168	"Is that so?"
2115010169	"Your master's item level is still {ContactEquipmentItemLevel}?"
2115010170	"My master needs to enchant. That's all."
2115010171	"Your master's level is {ContactUserLevel}?"
2115010172	"Level {UserLevel} is quick to reach."
2115010173	"Your master's level is {UserLevel}?"
2115010174	"I see."
2115010175	"My master is level {UserLevel}."
2115010176	"Stop being such a show off."
2115010177	" Your master's level is just {ContactUserLevel}?"
2115010178	"It must be nice to be level {ContactUserLevel}."
2115010179	"Is {ContactUserName} in the guild {ContactGuildName}?"
2115010180	"Interested?"
2115010181	"My master is {GuildName}'s most important member!"
2115010182	"Really?"
2115010183	"{ContactServantName}! Have a good day!"
2115010184	"{ContactServantName}! Have a nice day!"
2115010185	"You master is in {GuildName}, too?"
2115010186	"Hi there, neighbor."
2115010187	"How are things in {ContactGuildName}?"
2115010188	"The guild where {UserName} is the best."
2115010189	"{UserName}'s guild, {GuildName}, is the best."
2115010190	"{UserName}'s guild is the best there is!"
2115010191	"Your fellowship is already {ContactBuffGrade}?"
2115010192	"Am I quick?"
2115010193	"I'm only at fellowship {BuffGrade}."
2115010194	"Don't give up!"
2115010195	"My fellowship is {BuffGrade}."
2115010196	"I'm about the same."
2115010197	"{ContactServantName}'s fellowship is also at {BuffGrade}?"
2115010198	"Yes, I am."
2115010199	"Your fellowship is only {ContactBuffGrade}?"
2115010200	"Urgh... maybe..."
2115010201	"Why are you still at {BuffGrade}?"
2115010202	"Don't show off."
2116000000	"Farewell."

2117000055	"We will face each other one day."
2117000056	"A guardian...?"
2117000057	"I fight for my principles."
2117000058	"Manahan made us a promise."
2117010011	"One day, Arborea will belong to us."
2117010012	"For the honor of the draakons!"
2117010013	"May the draakons live forever!"
2117010014	"You will kneel before me."
2117010015	"Rogash? How do you know him?"
2117010016	"Rogash is the sneakiest person I know."
2117010017	"Rogash is not to be trifled with."
2117010018	"Lumikan? Do you mean the commander?"
2117010021	"I have sworn my loyalty to the commander."
2117010022	"Do you want to test me?"
2117010023	"You won't get anything out of me."
2117010024	"The core... couldn't be protected."
2117010025	"The Darkcore..."
2117010026	"Do you want to fight me?"
2117010027	"My tonfa is bloody."
2117010028	"Training is paramount."
2117010031	"Toughen up and train."
2117010032	"The path of a warrior isn't easy."
2117010033	"Train hard."
2117010034	"I'm ready to face you any time."
2117010035	"Everyone needs to be able to protect themselves."
2117010036	"Pain makes you stronger."
2117010037	"How sneaky."
2117010038	"Why did you do that?"
2117010039	"I don't understand."
2117010040	"Where are we?"
2117010041	"What did you do to me?"
2117010042	"Do you think my brothers will let you get away with this?"
2117010043	"Draakons don't leave their comrades behind."
2117010044	"Haha. Interesting."
2117010045	"That's not enough to bring me to my knees."
2117010046	"Bring me more."
2117010047	"I need to move."
2117010048	"?"
2117010049	"!"
2117010050	"?"
2117010051	"Don't order me around."
2117010052	"I'm not your servant."
2117010053	"Do I have to answer?"
2117010054	"My comrades will come and rescue me."
2117010055	"What do you want from me?"
2117010056	"You want my support?"
2117010057	"...."
2117010058	"No..."
2117010059	"Such a rookie."
2117010060	"This is unpleasant."
2117010061	"Pitiful skills."
2117010062	"Ha!"
2117010063	"Now it really begins."
2117010064	"This isn't over yet."
2117010065	"Draakons do not lose."
2117010066	"Am I reborn?"
2117010067	"Where am I?"
2117010068	"The argons will be revived."
2117010069	"Hehe."
2117010070	"Understood."
2117010071	"I'm on my way."
2117010072	"Wait."
2117010073	"I feel your strength."
2117010074	"Are you a competent person?"
2117010075	"What's your name, {ContactServantName}?"
2117010076	"Guardian... {ContactServantName}."
2117010077	"{ContactUserName}, you are nicely equipped with {EquipmentItemLevel}."
2117010078	"{ContactServantName}, you are like me."
2117010079	"{UserName}! Let me go."
2117010080	"I will have my revenge on you, {UserName}."
2117010081	"{ContactServantName}? What do you say?"
2117010082	"Poor {ContactServantName}..."
2117010083	"Is {ContactUserName} a competent person?"
2117010084	"{ContactUserLevel} is enough."
2117010085	"I feel a {UserLevel} power."
2117010086	"{UserLevel} isn't bad."
2117010087	"{ContactUserName}, you belong to {ContactGuildName}."
2117010088	"{ContactBuffGrade} needs to be improved."
2117010089	"My combat power is tireless {BuffGrade}."
2118000000	"Take the field."
2118000011	"Unworthy creature, kneel before me!"
2118000012	"You dare to raise your head before me?!"
2118000013	"Show your commander some respect!"
2118000014	"Where is your leader?"
2118000015	"Are you challenging me, pipsqueak?"
2118000016	"A rebellious little pipsqueak!"
2118000017	"How dare you, worm!"
2118000018	"Very well, submit!"
2118000021	"Unworthy creatures do nothing but struggle."
2118000022	"Wouldn't you rather serve me?"
2118000023	"You don't think you have beaten me?"
2118000024	"No weapon is a match for my spear!"
2118000025	"Such bad luck!"
2118000026	"You sully my shadow."
2118000027	"You will feel that!"
2118000028	"Your nightmare takes its course."
2118000031	"Watch your step!"
2118000032	"This is getting tight!"
2118000033	"Try dodging."
2118000034	"You are pitiful."
2118000035	"You'll go up in flames!"
2118000036	"Today is the day of the spear."
2118000037	"This is terrible to watch."
2118000038	"Is that all?"
2118000041	"Could you at least make an effort?"
2118000042	"Show some grit!"
2118000043	"How can that not move you?"
2118000044	"Come to your senses and lay down your weapons!"
2118000045	"I can see directly into your heart."
2118000046	"I'll see you tonight in your dreams."
2118000047	"I am profoundly unimpressed."
2118000048	"What's that? You want to be my slave?"
2118000051	"You won't escape me!"
2118000052	"How invigorating."
2118000053	"Like a newborn naga..."
2118000054	"Draakon? Don't make me laugh!"
2118000055	"You are unworthy."
2118000056	"Go on, call your leader!"
2118000057	"Do you enjoy this kind of thing?"
2118000058	"You laugh?"
2118010011	"Bah, pathetic."
2118010012	"You are a lowly creature."
2118010013	"Is that all you can muster?"
2118010014	"Don't be ashamed."
2118010015	"I don't have all day!"
2118010016	"Get out of my way!"
2118010017	"You are still no match for a draakon."
2118010018	"The best you can do is compete with naga."
2118010021	"Mournwing would be delighted with some extra food, though."
2118010022	"I guess you're no more than a stooge."
2118010023	"You're nothing but mournwing fodder!"
2118010024	"Even the simplest of tasks overwhelm you."
2118010025	"Get lost!"
2118010026	"What do you want from me?"
2118010027	"I could use you. Don't you want to serve me?"
2118010028	"So, how about it? Do you want to be a commander?"
2118010031	"Splendid! Stay by my side."
2118010032	"Serve me and I will spare your life."
2118010033	"How pathetic."
2118010034	"You don't want to be petted, do you?"
2118010035	"Serve me faithfully, and it'll be worth your while."
2118010036	"Become my humble servant."
2118010037	"You are truly pathetic."
2118010038	"So stay and amuse me!"
2118010039	"You are good for nothing."
2118010040	"Pitiful."
2118010041	"You are a servant of the naga?"
2118010042	"Hm..."
2118010043	"Arborea's creatures are so adorable."
2118010044	"Become Azart's servant!"
2118010045	"You are very similar to the naga."
2118010046	"Too tasty."
2118010047	"You perform almost as well as a mournwing."
2118010048	"Such a low standard..."
2118010049	"You want to be a draakon?"
2118010050	"Azart, don't make me laugh."
2118010051	"Any famous last words?"
2118010052	"Join the draakons!"
2118010053	"You might have a chance."
2118010054	"I like you."
2118010055	"You could come in useful."
2118010056	"You'll be well looked after in my petting zoo."
2118010057	"You are trembling. Do you want your mommy?"
2118010058	"I will spare you."
2118010059	"Vergos' power! But where is it coming from...?"
2118010060	"You dare...?"
2118010061	"Use all your strength!"
2118010062	"Lay down your weapons!"
2118010063	"Surrender, and I will spare your life."
2118010064	"Your existence is slowly becoming torture."
2118010065	"Do not even speak Vergos' name!"
2118010066	"You are not worthy to speak his name!"
2118010067	"Your insolence stinks to high heaven."
2118010068	"You are giving me orders?"
2118010069	"How dare you attack me?"
2118010070	"Grilled Pigling?"
2118010071	"Running away?"
2118010072	"An encounter with me has only one outcome: your death."
2118010073	"Silence!"
2118010074	"You are a disgrace."
2118010075	"{ContactServantName}?"
2118010076	"{ContactServantName}!"
2118010077	"{ContactUserName}, aren't you ashamed of {EquipmentItemLevel}?"
2118010078	"{ContactServantName}, you're an embarrassment."
2118010079	"{UserName}, such a puny name."
2118010080	"They call you {UserName}?"
2118010081	"{ContactServantName}, you're as small as you are weak."
2118010082	"{ContactServantName}! Won't you submit to me?"
2118010083	"{ContactUserName}, you are hilarious."
2118010084	"Please make an effort, {ContactUserLevel}."
2118010085	"{UserLevel}, you are a disgrace."
2118010086	"{UserLevel}, I pity you."
2118010087	"{ContactUserName}, you belong to {ContactGuildName}? Your path is still a long and rocky one."
2118010088	"{ContactBuffGrade}, a most pitiful choice."
2118010089	"{BuffGrade}, a good choice."
2119000000	"Come on, here I am."
